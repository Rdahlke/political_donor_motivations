In consultation with our Adjutant General, who also serves as my Homeland Security Advisor, it is clear that the influx of Syrian refugees poses a threat.



With this in mind, I am calling upon the President to immediately suspend the program pending a full review of its security and acceptance procedures.  The State of Wisconsin will not accept new Syrian refugees.""

We need to keep our focus forward. We will continue to explore other opportunities to bring additional jobs to Kenosha and grow opportunity in southeastern Wisconsin through a pro-job and strong business focus.

We must prioritize and provide consistent support to things like public schools before we can begin to consider prioritizing for extraneous projects.

"Senator Risser Statement on Governor’s Budget Bill



Governor Walker’s budget proposal is clearly aimed at a national audience at the expense of the citizens of our state.  



The Governor proposes to borrowing $1.3 billion to build new highways for two years while our public schools crumble.  



Public education is the state’s biggest and most important investment yet Governor Walker proposes gutting the University of Wisconsin by $300 million.  This is in stark contrast with the Republican governors of other Midwestern states, notably Ohio, Indiana and Iowa, which are increasing their funding for higher education.  



Also, Wisconsin is now the only Great Lakes state to refuse federal funds to strengthen our Medicaid program.  Accepting federal healthcare dollars could help prevent funding cuts to local schools, public health, police and fire services, local infrastructure repair, and many other important programs and services.

Rob Brooks (R-Saukville) and Brandtjen will provide oversight as to what food items may be purchased by those using taxpayer dollars to help feed their families.  



Right now a family of four can get up to $649 per month to provide food for their families.  Under current law, the head of the household can spend the entire amount on non-nutritional items that could lead to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and other health related issues.  



“We in the legislature have an obligation to make sure hard earned tax dollars are spent appropriately.  While I’m confident that most families do not abuse the program this bill assures that 67% of the food share dollars provided to families are spent on healthy foods including meats, vegetables and dairy products.” Brandtjen said. “The bill is about protecting the integrity of a program that uses taxpayer dollars.” She added.



In addition to the requirement that 67% of foodshare dollars a family spends is spent on nutritious food, the bill also prohibits the purchase of high end items such as lobster, crab or shrimp. Representative Brandtjen points out that the families who currently make nutritious purchases will not notice a change in the program.",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Today we celebrate Labor Day. 



Labor Day is a time to reflect on the significant contributions Wisconsin’s workers have made to our state. It’s also a time for us to consider how we can improve Wisconsin’s workplace conditions.  



Since the early 20th century, Wisconsin’s workforce has sought fair treatment and workplace conditions for all. In fact, Wisconsin was an early supporter of the labor movement, passing the first workman’s compensation law in 1911. 



Despite initial progress in workers’ rights, harmful anti-worker legislation which severely limited public and private unions, and the repeal of the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, which resulted in equal pay for men and women – have made their way into Wisconsin law.



Today, with a minimum wage set at $7.25, low-wage workers are struggling to make ends meet. Also, women in Wisconsin are paid an average of 78 cents for every dollar men are paid. 



These wage inequalities put our Wisconsin workforce in a competitive disadvantage nationally, hurting not only individual workers and their families, but also our state’s economy as a whole.  



Wisconsin Democrats have stressed the importance of workers’ rights, and we continue to fight for fair wages for low-income workers, for women’s rights to equal pay, and for the right of all Wisconsinites to a safe work environment. 



Our workers are the backbone of our economy, and it is only with their success that Wisconsin can achieve true prosperity.

In 1894 the Labor Movement convinced the federal government to dedicate the first Monday each September to American workers and their fight for rights in the workplace.  They also dedicated it to the celebration of the social and economic achievements and well-being brought to us by American workers.



But Labor Day, and really the whole weekend, is a time for Americans also to thank the teachers, sanitation workers, construction trades workers, home health workers, snowplow drivers, nurses and all the workers who make it possible for us and our loved ones to live free of the diseases, ignorance, dangers and inconveniences that people over a century ago lived with constantly.  



Here in Wisconsin some might think we have little to celebrate since Governor Walker began his attack on working families in 2011.  I disagree. I believe that the Labor Movement is coming back bigger and stronger than ever!



Take the time this Labor Day to show your support for workers and their families by joining in your community’s celebrations.  March with your unions, attend their parades and cheer on our workers!  



I will be joining my friends from IBEW on Monday, Sept. 7th in the Milwaukee Labor Day parade to Laborfest at the Summerfest grounds (details below).  Hope to see you there! 



Laborfest 2015 ( Mon, Sept. 7th) begins with the 11:00 am parade at the Wisconsin Workers Memorial in Zeidler Square downtown, and continues at the Summerfest grounds until 5:00 pm. 



As always, Laborfest is free and open to the public, with plenty to eat and drink, live music, games and fun for kids, professional wrestling (!), a classic car show, and a raffle to win a Harley Davidson bike. 

 

Laborfest is organized and sponsored by local unions and businesses like I.B. Electrical Workers Local 494; United Steel Workers Local 2-292; the Harley-Davidson Motor Company; the MillerCoors Company and its trade unions; and the Milwaukee Area Labor Council.",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Nearly one million Wisconsin student loan borrowers have over $19 billion in debt and the best Gov. Walker can manage is to hold a press conference announcing he is doing nothing and they should go talk to a bank or visit a website.

That’s how, on his watch, Wisconsin has risen to third highest in the nation for percentage of college graduates with student loan debt.



“And they’ve spent four years opposing a common sense plan that would actually help borrowers refinance their student loans, at no net cost to taxpayers.

From issuing millions in corporate welfare to individuals committing fraud to this latest development where $21 million in tax credits were illegally issued by the State – WEDC has been an embarrassment to our state for years. 



“The biggest Christmas present that Governor Walker and legislative Republicans could give the taxpayers this holiday season is to shut WEDC down. Our Governor couldn’t come close to meeting his 250,000 job creation campaign promise and now in 2015 Wisconsin has almost doubled the number of layoffs from 2014. This is an agency surrounded by fraud, waste and abuse and it’s time legislative Republicans admit they were wrong and agree to shut WEDC down.”

"In November 2012, Governor Walker appointed Reed Hall, an attorney and director of Marshfield Clinic, as the interim CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), the governor's flagship jobs agency.



The appointment puzzled many due to Reed Hall's lack of experience in economic development. 



After a $40,000 national search for a new CEO paid for by Wisconsin taxpayers, the governor decided instead to remove the 'interim' from Reed Hall's title and name him CEO of WEDC. Mr. Hall had contributed to Gov. Walker's campaign in the past.



A few weeks ago, while discussing WEDC's continued failures, I stood on the Assembly floor and said about WEDC, ""If you're not outraged, then you're not paying attention."" Under Governor Walker's leadership, WEDC has been an unmitigated disaster.



Since those remarks, WEDC has continued to show its lack of competence. Most recently, we learned that more than two dozen awards worth more than $124 million were made to companies without a formal staff review by WEDC's underwriting department.

Is it because they'd have to confront the millions of dollars and obvious cronyism that involved their big campaign spenders? Is it because we're talking about huge amounts of money going to rich folks instead of help being given to those in need? 



Is it because they find it easier to pick on working class neighbors than to confront their white collar cronies?



Any way you slice it this is the Wisconsin they've crafted. Corruption, cronyism, jobs leaving left and right, and an education system that's spiraling out of control in order to appease privatizing corporate masters like Scott Jensen.

"Wisconsin Senate Democrats 

2015 Badger Blueprint agenda



Today the Senate Democrats announced the WI Badger Blueprint. We have been and remain committed to listening to people throughout the state and this agenda reflects that. It includes a wide range of positive new ideas and proven solutions to create economic opportunities for all and restore fairness in our state. 



I want to share and echo the comments of our Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling: “The Badger Blueprint is a reflection of our shared Wisconsin values and it provides a clear vision to help strengthen our state.  By focusing on policies that encourage growth, drive innovation and increase economic opportunities, we can move Wisconsin forward in a positive direction.”



Wisconsin Senate Democrats 

2015 Badger Blueprint agenda



Wisconsin’s hardworking families want leaders to work together and focus on improving the economy, strengthening the middle class and boosting family wages. 



The Badger Blueprint agenda that Senate Democrats are putting forward includes a wide range of new ideas and proven solutions to create economic opportunities and help move Wisconsin forward.



Many of these proposals should have bipartisan support and we are hopeful that the majority party will work with us to focus on these issues and address the challenges that our state is facing. 



Senate Dem Badger Blueprint agenda:



• Growth

o Senate Democrats understand that the best way to move Wisconsin forward is by growing the middle class and expanding economic security. 

o From early childhood to technical training and college – ensuring educational opportunities for all Wisconsin residents will boost our long-term ability to compete and succeed in the modern day, global market.



• Innovation

o For Wisconsin to be competitive in today’s global economy, we need a modern and well-maintained infrastructure. 

o From our roads and bridges, to our water treatment and sewer systems, to our broadband and rail networks – it’s time to reinvest in Wisconsin’s infrastructure to encourage business growth, foster workforce opportunities and attract private investments.



• Opportunity

o Too many Wisconsinites are being held back by a system that has been designed by special interests to give the wealthy and big businesses a greater advantage over hardworking families. 

o Through targeted middle class tax relief and improved workplace flexibilities for Wisconsin families, we can restore fairness in our state, increase economic opportunities and strengthen our communities.

""At its best, America too is about helping workers earn family-earning wages. America is about helping people get access to good health care, and secure their pensions for their retirement. America is about helping young people pursue training at schools and tech colleges, and work in safe workplaces. Americans pay our dues—our federal, state, and local income taxes—and we don’t ever like to pay them and we don’t always agree with what our government does. But is it fair to get the benefits of the American union without paying our dues? Would anyone in this room feel more free by opting out of America?

For Immediate Release             March 6, 2015



Statement by Rep. Mary Czaja on Vote for Worker Freedom



Madison… Today, after a marathon 24-hour session, the Wisconsin State Assembly has voted to pass Senate Bill 44, commonly referred to as the Right-to-Work legislation. After passage, Rep. Mary Czaja (R-Irma) issued the following statement:



“I cast my vote in favor of the Right-to-Work legislation for two reasons. First, this is an issue of worker freedom. Right-to-Work protects the right for Wisconsin workers to freely associate and preserves their ability to pay membership dues voluntarily rather than by force. I firmly believe it is the right of the worker to make that choice, and I will always stand up for personal freedoms.



“My second reason for supporting the bill is to help Wisconsin remain competitive with both our neighboring Midwestern states and the global economy. Just this week we heard testimony in the Joint Finance Committee that 70% of employers consider the Right-to-Work status of a state when deciding where to invest and grow jobs. The state of Wisconsin and our northern economy cannot afford to be left out of that equation. I have appreciated the many calls and contacts from constituents over the last couple weeks, and I am committed to working together in growing our state’s business climate.”



Senate Bill 44 now moves to the Governor’s desk for his approval; he is expected to sign the bill next week Monday.",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Wisconsin should be a right-to-work state. The public widely supports worker freedom and the potential positive impact to the state’s economy can no longer be ignored.

Unemployment is down. There is not a shortage of jobs there is a shortage of jobs that pay a living wage. There are two ways to take people off the welfare rolls effectively. 1. Dismantle all the social programs. You can't access programs that don't exist. 2. Raise the minimum wage to 12.55 an hour.

You also provide affordable child care by implementing state subsidized programs that allow family members to care for your children while you either work or go to school if you qualify based on your income. We have programs in place that will subsidize childcare in a child development center or similar setting already. But, they have to charge more for their services due to overhead, paying staff, lease, insurance etc. they do not provide overnight care. A real gap in services for third shifters. And they often do not provide care for infants. If you allow, for example a grandparent or other family member of a child to care for the child/ten and be paid (much less than you would a center) it would in many cases supplement their fixed income such as SS. Give the child's parents a greater piece of mind because the child is with someone they know and trust. And it will allow them to succeed at work or school. Lastly, it would save taxpayers money because you do not have to pay them as much. I know this works, when I was going to college I took advantage of a program like this in Texas. My sister who had Lupus and was disabled cared for my 3 kids. We all benefitted, she supplemented her income, I completed my education and my kids got to spend time with their aunt and cousins.",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We need to ask ourselves why our school budgets are in crisis.



The current state budget is THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN STATE HISTORY. Yet somehow we're told that to prevent our schools from closing, we have to raise our own taxes via referendum.



If we're spending more money than ever before, why is the current administration telling us they don't have enough to fund our schools? If we're spending more money than ever before, where is it going?



The answer lies with corporations legally-bribing politicians with campaign contributions. These politicians then spend our tax dollars to increase the company's profits.



One big example is Travis Tranel's vote for the ""Manufacturing and Agriculture Credit."" It gives away $284 million annually, 78% of which goes to people earning more than $1 million a year. Why is he taking tax dollars from working families and giving them to the wealthiest people in the state? ...And if this was supposed to create jobs and “trickle down” to the middle class, why is Wisconsin's economy lagging behind the nation and our region?



Another example is replacing publicly-run state services with FOR-PROFIT companies (voucher schools; $100 million increase in private contractors administering medicaid since 2011; Medicaid spending increased by $3 billion while the number of people served barely increased). Why did Travis “ALEC” Tranel vote to suck money from our community schools and send it to FOR-PROFIT schools, all of which are located outside of our district?



The answer is legal-bribery. That's why this referendum issue keeps popping up. It's not that there isn't money in the budget, its that these bought-and-paid-for politicians are funneling it to their profit-crazy campaign contributors.



Together we can do better.

www.bennett4assembly.com



FYI: We also need to redesign our school funding formula to compensate for the depopulation of rural areas. ...But they don't want to fix the problem, they want our schools to fail so we'll support their agenda to turn them over to their FOR-PROFIT voucher school donors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New WI memo: School funding cut nearly $200 million by Gov. Walker and GOP ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yesterday, the Assembly Committee on Education held a public hearing on AB 581, a bill which would lower qualifications needed to obtain a teaching degree. After this year’s contentious budget, which contained provisions that also lowered teaching qualifications, I was hopeful that the damage to the teaching profession would end there. Unfortunately, this bill further diminishes teaching by allowing individuals without proper experience to teach in Wisconsin middle and high schools.



The solution to fill a teaching gap is not “allow anyone to teach” but to lift up the profession by hiring bright, qualified teachers, respecting and supporting the important work they do every day. There are already eleven non-traditional pathways to obtaining a teaching license in Wisconsin. AB 481 goes too far.

"Next week I will be traveling to the country of Chile. Where I will bring my wife's ashes to her resting place over looking the Pacific Ocean. 



I am looking forward to visiting with my Chilean family and friends. 



Every time I think of Chile, our Wisconsin public school system comes to my mind.  My beautiful Chilean grand daughter, Sarah, started pre-k in LaCrosse while her father studies as a foreign graduate student at UWL.



My step son is amazed at the quality of education Sarah is receiving.  In Chile public education is improving, but most middle class and upper class families send their children to private schools. 



I worked at one of the best knowned and most expensive private schools in Chile. In my opinion, the Nekoosa Public Schools, where I worked for 18 years, provides a overall better education than that expensive Chilean private school.



Why have we repeatedly heard the matra: our public schools are failing? We need to ask ourselves where did this matra come from, and why is it being repeated. 



There are numerous organizations that seek to privatize Wisconsin Public Education. ALEC, the American Legislation Exchange Council, who receives funding from the Koch brothers and other billionaires have the privatization of Wisconsin Public Schools near the top of their agenda. The American Federation for Children is another organization that is trying to privatize our public schools.



Corporate America has very good reasons for convincing us our Traditional Public Schools are failing. They want to cash in on our kids, and they are getting help to that end from our elected officials who put corporate interests before the interests of our communities.



Here in the 72nd district our public schools have in recent years lost valuable educational programs and have experienced rising class sizes. Meanwhile, districts have to pay the tuition of students already attending private schools. 



Around the state communities are faced with raising property taxes to pay for the added expense of private school vouchers.



Again, who asked for this? Was it the members of our communities, or was it corporations who want to cash in on our kids. 



Scott Krug's campaign has taken donations from the American Federation for Children, and he also accepted an ALEC ""Scholarship."" In fact his largest contributor in 2012 was the American Federation for Children. They gave his campaign a whooping  $12,000. This may have been a reward for sponsoring a Special Education Voucher bill in 2011.



Our elected officials need to do the will of the people not the will of their big donors.

If we truly wanted to build a strong Wisconsin community, we would be debating how to support public education and strengthen our local governments and businesses. Instead, the budget that was passed today deprives our public schools yet again, while pushing our transportation debt onto future generations, along with many policy items that have nothing to do with our fiscal situation. This budget does not reflect the values or priorities of the people of our state, and I am disappointed in the bill that was passed tonight.



However, our work is certainly not done. I believe building a successful community is an ongoing process that doesn't stop with a bad budget.

"HESSELBEIN: STUDENTS AND FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES WIN

IN JOINT FINANCE ACTION TO KEEP EDUCATIONAL APPROVAL BOARD

Rep. Dianne Hesselbein today praised the vote of the Joint Finance Committee not to eliminate the Educational Approval Board, calling it a victory for both students and schools.

“Keeping the Educational Approval Board alive and on guard is a win for students, who will be protected from exploitation, and a win for schools, which will be protected against unscrupulous competition and given legitimacy,” said Hesselbein, D-Middleton. “It will also save the state more than $100,000 a year in contributions to the general fund.

“On April 16, I issued an appeal to save the agency in which I said: ‘We hope that cool heads will prevail when the Joint Finance Committee takes up the elimination of the Educational Approval Board and that this misbegotten proposal will simply and quietly go away.’ That is what exactly what has happened. Everyone should applaud this victory for good government as we begin our national holiday.”

The Educational Approval Board, established nearly 60 years ago, gives annual fitness checkups and certifications to 174 for-profit institutions and 78 out-of-state nonprofit schools, with a total enrollment of 60,000. They range from large universities like Globe, the University of Phoenix and DeVry to specialized schools like the Sun Prairie Diesel Truck Driving School.

Gov. Scott Walker proposed in his budget to eliminate the independent EAB and scatter some of its functions to other state offices. That proposal failed Thursday night in a 12-4 vote on an omnibus motion that scrapped several of the governor’s agency merger and reorganization plans. Democrats on Joint Finance voted against the motion because they wanted separate consideration of the troubled Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""In the last decade, Wisconsin has cut back sharply on funding its state university system.



In 2003, students paid about 30 percent of the University of Wisconsin system’s total educational cost, according to data compiled by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. By 2013, after several rounds of state budget cuts, students were responsible for about 47 percent, and more state cuts to higher education are expected.



By 2014, 70 percent of Wisconsin students graduated with debt—the third-highest percentage in the nation for students at public and nonprofit colleges, according to the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success, or TICAS.



We ought to invest in the future, not take from the future,” says Thomas G. Mortenson, a senior scholar at the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education. “Where I used to live we called that eating our seed corn.”

At the eleventh hour, the presentations were cancelled. With the UW System just months away from submitting its next budget, the UW Board of Regents has yet to even consider the effects of the last one. 



In keeping with his promise of ""open government,"" Governor Walker should call for an open, accountable public hearing with the UW Board of Regents.

"Last night I had the pleasure of attending Emerge Wisconsin's annual Woman of the Year dinner in Milwaukee.  I am a proud graduate of the Emerge Wisconsin Class of 2015, so these events are very important to me. 



The organization is dedicated to electing more women to local, state and federal office because, as Executive Director Erin Forrest pointed out, there are still far too few women at all those levels. 



While Wisconsin has elected more than 200 men to Congress since statehood, only two women - Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Gwen Moore - have held similar offices in this state.  



Things aren't much better on the local level. 74% of Wisconsin's town boards and 24% of the state's village boards currently have NO women members.  The current male-to-female ratio in the Wisconsin Legislature is 75% men to 25% women.



This year's Woman of the Year is Heather Colburn, president of Colburn Consulting in Madison, and a successful, behind-the-scenes adviser for many political candidates and organizations. Colburn used her acceptance speech to encourage those in the room, especially the women, to support aspiring women everywhere.  



""That's why we have two hands,"" Colburn said. ""One hand is to help you climb the ladder of success yourself. The other is to help the women behind you also break glass ceilings.""



She also urged attendees to say ""Yes"" when female candidates ask for financial support. ""Making those fundraising calls is one of the hardest thing a woman candidate does,"" Colburn said. ""When she calls you, please give. Give generously.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,

As a result, we have taken several giant steps backward when it comes to equal access to health care, pay equity, and even the right to vote on Election Day. Though Women’s Equality Day marks a critical milestone to celebrate, it is important to remember that women still face significant challenges in gaining full equality.

Rep. Dave Considine Comments on Gov. Walker’s Budget Address



MADISON – Tonight, Governor Scott Walker delivered his 2015-2017 biennial budget address in the Assembly Chambers. Representative Dave Considine issued the following statement regarding the Governor’s budget.



“My focus, and the focus of my Assembly Democratic colleagues, is on restoring economic opportunities for Wisconsin families. I sincerely hope Governor Walker will join us in this goal, but I am very concerned about the priorities he has outlined in his budget for the next biennium,” said Rep. Considine.



In his address, Gov. Walker referenced plans to give the state’s outstanding University of Wisconsin system more autonomy in funding. However, he failed to mention that this would mean cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars, in addition to tuition freezes for both the UW System and our technical colleges. He also announced his intention to rely on $1.3 billion in borrowed money to fund transportation projects, further indebting future generations. Finally, the Governor announced plans to lift the cap on vouchers, taking more money away from our precious public school systems which have made our state great.



“These ideas will not create jobs or the economic, educational, or recreational opportunities Wisconsinites so badly need, and they are not the solutions to our state’s problems,” Rep. Considine stated. “Instead of taking aim at public education and continuing to borrow funds on top of a $280 million budget deficit, we should be working together to create sustainable jobs and ensure that every child in Wisconsin has access to a high-quality education.”

"If my colleagues across the aisle really believe in the First Amendment, they should put their money where their mouth is and sign onto my bill protecting public employees first amendment rights and their right to be free of retaliation by the Governor and Legislature!  



Here's a sneak peak of the co-sponsorship memo I sent around yesterday:



“Free speech rights need to be protected.  I will always fight for free speech… I fundamentally believe in free speech.  Free speech should not be allowed in some cases and restricted in others.  As Republicans, we should be advocating for individual liberties and not limiting them.” - Rep. Scott Allen (R-Waukesha) October 20 & 21



“There is nothing more un-American than being investigated, interrogated and intimidated because you have exercised your First Amendment Rights by engaging in the political process.” – Rep. Janel Brandtjen (R-Menomonee Falls) October 22



“Protecting constitutional rights is something every legislator has sworn an oath to do.  The First Amendment right to speech is first for a reason.” Sen. Tom Tiffany (R-Hazelhurst) and Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) October 9



Indeed, as our colleagues recognize above, First Amendment rights should be respected for all, whether you are singing in the Capitol rotunda, holding a sign in the Assembly Gallery or as a public employee, expressing an opinion.  



Yet too often, we hear of public employees who are targeted for simply doing their jobs.  Threats of losing staff, having an office budget eliminated, being transferred to another unit or eliminated.  A few recent examples…



Talk about Global Warming?  Gag order.  

Print the findings of your scientific research?  Staff positions eliminated.

Follow the law and faithfully execute the duties of your position?  Bureau transferred and direct oversight given to political appointee. 

Write a letter to the editor?  Not so fast – you received an internal memo saying you couldn’t discuss your job publicly.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I joined my colleagues in welcoming Canadian Consul General Roy Norton to the state Capitol yesterday. Consul General Norton is visiting the state this week as part of Canada Week in Wisconsin.



I was happy to be part of Canada Day at the state Capitol, and to welcome Consul General Norton to Wisconsin. Our Wisconsin/Canadian relations are a very important part of our economy. Wisconsin sells more goods to Canada than the next six largest foreign markets combined.



While in Madison, Consul General Norton was on hand as the state Assembly passed Assembly Joint Resolution 76, proclaiming October 26 to 30, 2015, as Canada Week in Wisconsin, and Tuesday, October 27, 2015, as Canada Day at the state Capitol.



The Consul General had the following to say about his visit:



“Our welcome in the state Capitol today could not have been warmer. This underscores the tremendous relationship between Canada and Wisconsin. We are one another's best customers with more than $12.4 billion in annual trade between us. I look forward to visiting again and to further grow this mutually beneficial relationship.""



In addition to the strong trade relations, the US hosts more tourists from Canada than any other country. Wisconsin welcomes 320,700 Canadian visitors every year, putting $65 million into our tourism industry.



The Consul General will be traveling around Wisconsin this week, ending his trip in Madison on Saturday.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barnes, who hope(d) to amend the changes to delay their implementation past 2016, pointed to the 59 Wisconsin towns that have already passed non-binding referenda against the Supreme Court's landmark Citizens United decision.



""'I’ve talked to Republicans who have heartburn about the bill,' Barnes said. 'But are they gonna vote against it? I don’t think so. The 2016 cycle is going to be a presidential election, and Democrats have traditional outperformed in cycles like that. Governor Walker's approval rating has fallen below 40 percent, and Republicans are going to be tied to him. Is that why we're seeing these bills now? To me, that seems like a conflict of interest.'""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Never mind that the federal deficit has decreased over 67% during President Obama's term.)  The group held a lobby day at the Capitol today.



An elderly gentleman visited my office this afternoon to drop off petitions supposedly from my constituents in support of this effort.  One of the names seemed very familiar.  I received an e-mail from this woman a year ago on the same issue.  I sent her a hard-copy letter at that time explaining my position.



Imagine my surprise when the woman’s daughter contacted me to say her mother had been deceased for over a year!  I contacted the Convention of the States people, but never heard back.



I am appalled and disgusted that this group would still be using the name of this woman who has been dead for TWO YEARS now to try to advance its cause.  How can I, or any of my legislative colleagues, trust the veracity of any communications we get from these people?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,

Indeed, if the last three weeks of public discourse have taught white progressives anything, it's that one year after Ferguson, we still fail to listen more than we talk.



So while I could have devoted the 600 words I’m allowed here to talk about systemic, structural and institutional racism, I’m going to stop here as a symbolic reminder and plea to myself and my fellow white progressives: There’s a difference between complacent silence and actively listening, and we can and must listen better.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,

Thank you to all of you for the support and trust you have placed in me.  



I’m also deeply grateful for the confidence the voters have placed in me with their votes today.  I am looking forward to a spirited general election campaign and I will continue to run a positive campaign based on issues.  



 I also want to thank Vince Trudell and his family for stepping forward to run in our district. I am very happy I had the opportunity to get to know Vince and respect his genuine concern for this district's issues, his devotion to all of our families, and our communities. Thank you Vince.



As I look forward I am excited to talk about the issues that are important to our area. I would like to use my experience as a small businessman and a farmer to grow our local economy so that we have more good paying jobs for our families, expand economic growth, reduce government over-regulation, provide the best educational opportunities for our children and grandchildren, and reduce taxes.

HESSELBEIN: CAMP RANDALL RACISM SHOWS UGLY CLIMATE OF HATE

 

                The noose around the neck of an African-American figure wearing prison garb and an Obama mask at Camp Randall Stadium Saturday sent a shockwave of hate and fear to students who saw it, and it deserved a more forceful response, Rep. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said today.

 

                “This appalling stunt, though accompanied by political trappings and appearing on the same day as Freakfest, was no joke. It crossed the legal line that requires UW-Madison to maintain a safe and non-intimidating campus environment for every student. All students know this country’s traumatic history of lynching. It sent a violent warning.”

 

                The costumed offenders, one dressed as Obama and the other dressed as Donald Trump, were not in the student section and their tickets were re-sold, a spokeswoman for the Dean of Students said today. It is unclear whether they could be subjected to university discipline. But, “in the future, the university needs to respond more forcefully to hooligans,” Hesselbein said. “They should have been expelled immediately.”

Number two, we passed a bill that dismantled our ethics and elections watchdog, and the third made campaign finance changes that open the door to unlimited and secret spending by corporations and billionaires. 



Republicans are opening the door to corruption further with this fourth bill. I guess that when you talk about bad things happening in threes, that is only when it's happenstance - not when it’s by design. When it is by design, Republicans put forth four, not three, bills that open the door to corruption and ensure that our state is indeed open to corruption.”",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""New Hampshire's unemployment rate is nearly a full point lower than Wisconsin's, and the disparity on income measures is just as stark.  New Hampshire's median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation, and more than $15,000 higher than Wisconsin's. Not to mention that New Hampshire's business tax climate was ranked 7th best in the nation by the Tax Foundation, while Wisconsin ranked 43rd. Scott Walker should have checked the facts before trying to compare his failed economic record that's hurting middle class families across his state with Governor Hassan's record of encouraging innovation, expanding middle class opportunity, supporting small businesses, and moving New Hampshire's economy forward.""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a dangerous bill that will take away the opportunity for a woman who is facing a medically complex pregnancy to make private, personal medical decisions without government interference.



Wisconsin should protect the freedom and health security of women - not intrude into personal medical decisions that put their life and health at risk.  A woman’s medical safety is crucial, and these deeply personal decisions should be left to a woman in consultation with her physician, her family, and her faith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,

"First off, I know I am not running against Glenn Grothman. But when I get his email updates, I am appalled. His recent actions to de-fund the EPA on a national level, closely mirror the cuts that have happened to our DNR. Thanks to Grothman's bill (HR5538), the EPA can no longer enforce new greenhouse gas regulations onto power plants or methane requirements onto the oil and gas industry. 



Additionally, the EPA will no longer be allowed to /monitor/control water on private land. How can that even be legal? If you own the land, you don't own the water. My Republican opponent for State Assembly has similar plans for WI. He voted to allow the DNR to sell naming rights for our state parks. He voted to prohibit the DNR review of high capacity wells. He voted to oppose developing clean energy and he removed local authority to protect water from pollution.



Who asked for this? Really. What small business, family or farm doesn't want clean water and clean air? A healthy economy needs healthy natural resources.",,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to encourage you to join Sue and me in honoring those candidates and to commit tonight that starting tomorrow, we all do our part in aspiring to a higher level of political decorum, a higher level of statesmanship.  That starting tomorrow we realize that our opponents are our rivals, not our mortal enemies and that we lead our children in modeling respect for the individual and respect for authority.

It also assists states in returning youth who run away, escape or abscond across state lines.

"The organizing meeting of the Coordinated Campaign last night offered local Dems an upbeat diversion from the doom and gloom touted on our TVs from Cleveland. 



The theme of the night was ""Stronger Together,"" and - it's true - the feeling of energy and power in that room was unmistakable. 



Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Martha Laning told the more than 70 in attendance that Wisconsin Dems are more than ready to turn the state blue in 2016 and beyond. She and the DPW have hired a young, energetic crew to help state legislative candidates (like yours truly) try to take back the Assembly and State Senate. 



Laning said our top-of-the-ticket candidates Russ Feingold and Hillary Clinton are poised to win big, as long as people at the grassroots level stay focused on the issues, and keep promoting core Democratic principals like fairness, equality, and a fair shake for working men and women.



""I know you've heard people say every year that 'this is the most important election,' but this time it's really true,"" Laning said,. ""The stakes couldn't be higher."" 



Kyle Whelton, Sheboygan's full-time Democratic field organizer, reminded the group that face-to-face contact is still the best way to win elections.  ""Every positive contact you have with someone increases the chance by 10% that they will support your candidate,"" he said.  



Anyone interested in helping the Democratic Party between now and the election, should call Kyle at kwhelton@wivictory2016.org or 627-9082.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new school year is just beginning and we are asking you to assist us by volunteering to read at a school in need.  There is an opportunity to make significant progress in our community by putting out a call to arms to all Milwaukee residents to join us in the fight against poverty by volunteering to read with children in our community schools with the greatest needs.



We are going to put our money where our mouth is and volunteer every week to read one on one with Milwaukee students that require reading assistance.  The percentage of Milwaukee 3rd graders reading proficiently is 15% district wide for school year 2013-14. We are pledging to make a positive impact and we ask that you join us.  If just one in twenty readers of this article accepts our challenge and volunteers for one hour a week, we will have over 670,000 hours of additional directed reading time in our community schools.



To volunteer, please contact either of us at Rep.Kooyenga@legis.wisconsin.gov or Rep.Goyke@legis.wisconsin.gov and we will help connect you with the school requesting your assistance.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rep. Milroy Applauds UW-Superior Foundation on $25,000 Grant



MADISON- Representative Nick Milroy (D-South Range) congratulated the University of Wisconsin-Superior Foundation on its selection as a recipient of a $25,000 nonprofit grant from the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs at a ceremony on Thursday, January 15. 



UW-Superior Foundation was awarded the grant during a ceremony at the State Capitol in Madison. The foundation was one of 25 nonprofit organizations that received grants to help support programs that provide services to Wisconsin veterans.  Representing the UW-Superior Foundation was Jason Young, Development Officer at UW-Superior. 



“As a veteran, I recognize the unique challenges that face servicemen and women as they transition back into civilian life,” said Milroy.  “I commend UW-Superior for ensuring that soldiers and veterans receive the support they need through the Veteran and Nontraditional Student Center.”



The University’s Veteran and Nontraditional Student Center provides a variety of academic support, career advisory, and campus engagement services to students who are active duty or veteran members of the armed forces and their families.



“Investing in education should always be a priority, and it is particularly important that we do everything we can to ensure that those who serve our country receive the help that they need as they begin the next chapter of their lives,” Milroy concluded.

Good public policy often forms like a wave. It gathers momentum, at first with a ripple, then builds as congregating forces create something stronger. The policy finally crests when a critical mass is reached, and the politicians finally back the policy the public has been touting over time. Large pieces of legislation are passed when the people provide the momentum to create this wave.

Whereas the intent of Memorial Day is to honor and memorialize those who paid the ultimate price for our freedoms, Veterans Day is set aside to honor all of those who have served this country in the armed forces.



I would like to thank my late grandpa, Clarence Kremer (European Theater, WWII bugler and quartermaster), all of those who served with me in Kuwait and Iraq, my wife and family who supported my endeavors and all of those who have served and continue to serve our nation in an effort to protect everything that this great republic stands for - one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all!

We couldn't send a postcard to every house because of cost restrictions, so apologies in advance if you don't receive a card! Hopefully you'll meet me or a volunteer at the door instead.

I am a moderate who has spent his entire adult life working with people and businesses to solve their problems, create their opportunities, and achieve their goals.  It's what I believe in; it's what I do.



Our elected leaders in Madison seem to have forgotten that they are there to represent the people. They continue to do the same things over and over again, as if there would be a different outcome.  It’s time that we demand common sense, bipartisan cooperation, and a different way of thinking if we want solutions instead of bickering.

Representative Kulp Pushes to Expand Rural Health Care Access

Madison – 



Earlier this week, Representative Bob Kulp (R-Stratford) joined 22 other rural area legislators from across the state to announce the second phase of the Rural Wisconsin Initiative.  



The Rural Wisconsin Initiative’s goal is to improve health care access for all parts of the state, including rural areas.



“We have a well-deserved reputation in Wisconsin for exceptional health care access. To continue in that route, we want to make sure we are investing even more in our rural areas.   The rural areas of the state are more vulnerable to shortages in health care access and workforce,” Rep. Kulp said. 



The Rural Wisconsin Initiative legislation was developed with input from the Wisconsin Hospital Association and other health care organizations from across the state, and will fund items such as residency programs for rural physicians, training consortia for allied health professionals, clinical training programs for Advanced Practice Clinicians, and wellness programs in rural areas.



“I believe this legislation will attract young health care professionals to work and train in rural communities.  In turn, they will be able to see how attractive the quality of life is here,” Rep. Kulp said.

"Hello everyone. Such sadness today. Sorry about the length of this post. I have been sitting here, since this morning, wondering how to respond. And words fail me. After 911, I was equally scared and angry. I grew up in New York, I have family members that served on the police force in NYC. And the next day, at the facility I was working at in central WI, we had about 40 second graders coming for a field trip. We were trying to go on as normally as possible, but the teachers, the staff and myself – we were all numb. How would anything be normal again after the attacks on the World Trade Center? What were these children thinking? How were they feeling? What would I say to them?



Miraculously, the words came to me, as we were doing our intro to the day. I told the students we knew some scary stuff happened yesterday. But I didn’t want them to be scared. We had the best people in the world working on this – police, firemen, volunteers. And they were working really hard to make things right. I asked them, if we could have a moment of silence, and just send our best thoughts to all the workers at Ground Zero. One child raised her hand and asked, “Can we pray?” I almost lost it. I said, yes. Send your prayers and your best happy thoughts to those people.



And now, the events of the past month across our nation have left me reeling again. I know it’s a beautiful day today in Sheboygan, and everyone I love is safe. But I still have this feeling nothing will ever be the same. We are so divided as a nation. We are our own worst enemy. And healing words fail me. 



So today, I was just sad. And that’s ok. If you want to be sad, or cry, we all deserve that. But not for long. After today, we must get to work. Building our communities, healing our neighborhoods. We have to get to know our neighbors, meet a new family at church, shake hands with a police officer, volunteer at your child’s school, voice your ideas on tolerance and education. I feel that sending good thoughts to those in charge was good for my second graders, but not good enough for the rest of us.



Like I said, I have family members that served on the police, and I know that the profession is a family. My heart goes out to the families of those police officers that were lost and injured in Dallas, and who are killed and injured every day, protecting us. But like every family, there are pockets of racism and ignorance. I know police departments across the country will be addressing this. Now we need to look at ourselves, our families. We must make sure we are practicing tolerance. 



To those black family members that have lost loved ones due to police shootings, I cannot pretend to know what you are going through or how you feel. But I am so, so sorry. And I can say, that as I run for elected office, I understand more than ever how important it is to be a voice for everyone. Especially for children. No child should have to live in an environment of fear and confusion. 



Things will never be the same. And as I write this, I can see that that is a good thing. We deserve change – change in leadership, change in attitude, and change in expectations. We must ensure a better future for our children, and stop these tragedies we have to explain but cannot find the words. We must advocate in everything we do, that all lives matter, regardless of race, creed, physical/cognitive ability, financial status, employment, political affiliation, or sexual orientation. Because that is the country I would like to wake up to. So, thank you for reading. And now, let’s get to work.",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LRB 3908 would make the penalty for second and subsequent marijuana offenses a misdemeanor with a fine of no more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than six months.

LRB-3978 would allow a person who has a non-felony marijuana possession charge on their record to go to a court to get that record expunged if certain conditions are met, such as time since the conviction occurred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,

"State Representative Janel Brandtjen calls for funding cuts to Milwaukee until policies change:



For more information contact: June 7, 2016



Rep. Brandtjen- (414) 915-8425



Last week homeowners in Washington County were held hostage in their homes by the actions of 5 young criminals from Milwaukee. All night long the Milwaukee Police, SWAT teams and law enforcement from Washington County combed the darkness for 5 youths with guns. Families were forced to unlock their gun cabinets and instruct their loved ones to shoot to kill.



The violence and the crime that has plagued Milwaukee for decades has now begun to spill over into Milwaukee’s suburbs. I lay the responsibility for this growing and out of control problem at the door of the Mayor’s office. Mayor Barrett may not care about the safety of his family but I certainly do care about mine.



Mayor Barrett, the people of southeast Wisconsin will not sit by and watch your administration destroy the entire region with failed liberal policies and a 10 second “Tommy Tough Talk” sound bite. If you do not fill the hundreds of vacant police officer positions, apprehend and arrest car thieves, demand prison for repeat criminals and start standing up to the judges who let repeat offenders off easy you will be in my opinion “assisting and enabling” the very criminals who are responsible for the record number of shootings, car jacking’s and murders.



I will be openly advocating for funding cuts to Milwaukee unless steps are taken to dramatically cut crime in Milwaukee. I will no longer sit by while you destroy Milwaukee and its flourishing suburbs. I cannot justify financing your failed policies in Milwaukee until you take public safety seriously.

“Today we recognize the courageous 165,400 Wisconsin men and women who served our country in uniform during the Vietnam War and honor the 1,239 who lost their lives. We will never forget their sacrifices.”



“The State of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs have partnered to form a two-year commemoration named Operation Welcome Home. This initiative is part of our state and nation’s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. I encourage all veterans and families to visit the website below to learn more about Operation Welcome Home and how you can participate in this important initiative.”



“On behalf of the State of Wisconsin, and the residents of the 18th Assembly District, I would like to thank all veterans of the Vietnam War for their honorable service. We are forever grateful.”

Why is this important?  



Led by Justice David Prosser, now retired, all seven members of the Wisconsin Supreme Court signed a letter requesting this study.  Civil cases can be anything from small claims to complicated family law, where individuals are trying to represent themselves because they cannot afford legal representation. This can cause bad outcomes for all of the parties involved, delays and wasted time by individuals and the courts.



Our constitution promises to ""establish justice"", and we pledge ourselves to be “one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.” The goal of this committee is to help realize our promises.

January 15, 2015                                                                                                                                  

Wachs Opposes Chief Justice Selection Proposal

AJR1 passes Judice Committee along party lines; proposed amendment by Dems fails



MADISON- On Thursday, January 15, the Assembly Committee on Judiciary passed Assembly Joint Resolution 1 (AJR1) by a vote of 5-3. This proposal is the second consideration of a constitutional amendment that would change the selection process for Supreme Court Chief Justice from the current system of seniority to a vote by members of the Court. If the proposal is adopted by the Legislature, it will have to be approved by a statewide referendum in the April election.



“This proposal is an invasion of the sovereignty of our Supreme Court,” said Rep. Dana Wachs (D-Eau Claire), ranking Democratic member of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary. “The supporters of this bill are clearly politically motivated and want to remove the current Chief Justice. The current system of selecting a justice has been in place for many years, and it is not the job of the Legislature to intervene. There is a separation of powers between the three branches of our government for a reason, and this proposal is an unprecedented attempt to disrupt the balance of power in Wisconsin.” 



Reps. Wachs, Gary Hebl (D-Sun Prairie) and Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee) offered an amendment that would change the effective date to coincide with the end of the current Chief Justice’s term. This amendment was defeated on a party-line vote.



“We offered this amendment as a way for the supporters of the bill to demonstrate that their actions are not politically motivated,” added Wachs. “This amendment would also have circumvented procedural and substantive due process problems that this bill gives rise to. As passed, this bill in its application may violate rights afforded by the 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. I am extremely disappointed in this vote, and I hope that my colleagues from across the aisle will seriously consider the ramifications of this action when the bill is brought before the full Assembly for a vote.”",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If Title IX addressed ""sex"" on the basis of one's perceived reality, then why in the world would Section 1686 of Title IX state:

Representative Sargent: Upskirting Bill Protects Privacy



MADISON - Last week, Representative Melissa Sargent (D-Madison) circulated a bill she co-authored with Representative Jim Ott (R-Mequon) for co-sponsorship. The bill addresses the issue of “upskirting”—using a camera or video recording device to take photos or videos up a person’s skirt or underneath a person’s clothing. 



Upskirting has become a significant problem in Wisconsin, but under current statutes, it is not a punishable offense.



“I was happy to work with Representative Ott to create a strong, bipartisan bill to address the growing issue of upskirting in Wisconsin. Advancements in technology require legislators to adapt and for our laws to evolve. I will continue to fight for the respect and protection of our citizens’ right to privacy and public safety.



Today, Representative Sargent testified on behalf of the legislation at a public hearing before the Judiciary Committee. If passed, the bill creates a felony offense for persons who knowingly take up skirting photos or videos of a person without their consent.



“No one should feel unsafe while doing everyday tasks like grocery shopping or riding the bus. Upskirting is an egregious violation of privacy and we must act swiftly to close this legislative loophole.""

Here is a key quote from the article:

""Republicans won their Assembly landslide last fall not on the campaign trail (as they did 10 years earlier) but in the drafting room. They won it thanks to the maps they drew three years earlier.""



Also:

""For most voters, it means that legislative elections have become a lot less meaningful, since there are so few truly competitive seats any more, and because Republican control of the Legislature is for the time being practically baked into the cake.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,

"Below are the remarks that I gave earlier today to commemorate Memorial Day:



""Today, we remember the sons and daughters of our country who stood their ground in conflicts across the world and sacrificed their lives so that we may live in freedom. We display our gratitude by gathering together, decorating gravesites, and attending commemorations like this one. 



It’s difficult to speak on occasions like this, because those we are here to remember have already said so much. In their sacrifice, they spoke volumes, and demonstrated for us the purest form of love. The Bible says in John 15:13 that “Greater love hath no man than this - that a man lay down his life for his friends.” Wisconsin’s fallen veterans laid down their lives for their fellow soldiers, for their families and friends, and for millions of people that they never had the opportunity to meet on this earth. 



We honor the fallen by preserving their memories; memories not only of what they have done, but of who they were – committed men and women who passed away far too young. 



We remember them with moments of silence, when in our stillness we feel the weight of the gift that they have given to us. 

These moments of silence are important, but what’s more important is what happens after the silence. 



Recently, I read an essay prepared by the American Legion. The essay reflects on the question asked of many veterans “Was it worth it?” That’s a question that can only be answered by those who have served. The essay compels each of us, however to “Make it worth it.” 



So when the moment of silence is over, I want to encourage each of you to “live life out loud”. Dare to dream big and do great things. Get involved in your community. Prioritize patriotism over politics. Make a difference. We owe it not only to ourselves, but to those who sacrificed their lives so that we could live in a free and peaceful society – one that affords each of us so many opportunities.  



In America, it is traditional to celebrate all veterans on Veterans Day, and those who died in service to our country on Memorial Day. However, in closing, I want to blur the lines a bit. We can honor the sacrifice of those who have fallen by taking the time to care about their comrades who are still with us. 22 veterans commit suicide every day.  These casualties can be prevented. Be there for the veterans in your life – and for their families; listen to them, and support them. 



I would encourage you to seek out charities like the Honor Flights, Operation Homefront, or the Fisher House that work to ensure our veterans have access to the resources, care, and recognition that go beyond what the government provides. 



Thank you for the privilege of addressing you today. May God bless each of you, and those who have went before.""",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural Resources Board approves 2016 deer harvest quotas and season structure

 

The Wisconsin Natural Resources Board approved deer hunting season framework and antlerless deer quotas for 2016 at its May 25 meeting in Madison. Final season framework reflects recommendations from County Deer Advisory Councils.

 

Ten deer management units will not have an antlerless quota (each within the Northern and Central Forest zones), while the rest of Wisconsin will have a quota of 256,775 antlerless deer (compared to 224,735 in 2015).

 

A Holiday Hunt will be held in 13 counties and provide for an additional antlerless-only opportunity for firearm hunters from Dec. 24 to Jan.1. In addition, junior license holders in Ashland, Sawyer and Forest counties will not be allowed to harvest antlerless deer – these councils exercised their right to submit this recommendation in an effort to encourage increased herd growth.

 

As a reminder, bonus antlerless permit sales for the Forest zones begin Monday, Aug.15 at 10 a.m. Central Farmland Zone permits will go on sale Aug. 16, and Southern Farmland Zone bonus permits will be made available Aug. 17.



The department’s deer hunting webpage will be updated within the coming weeks with a number of helpful resources regarding hunting 2016 quotas and season framework. For more information, including an updated carcass tagging FAQ, search keyword “deer.”",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, carry this fact. 



It isn't. As usual the right lives in a fantasy world of their own making, but they have done a very good job of selling people on the idea that high taxes/high spending are ""facts"" as they have done on so many issues.



In fact someone did an analysis a few years back and found that the business groups in every state claimed that the taxes in their state were the highest. Well, well.



But because people have been lured onto these rocks by the Sirens of the right, we are not seeing fat cut in this state but muscle and bone.

"Representative Bowen released the following statement about the proposed ""Blue Day Rally"" happening at the Bavarian Bierhaus in Glendale this Sunday featuring Gov. Walker and members of the City of Milwaukee Common Council:



""It is critical with the consistent situations of disproportionate black citizens killed by the unnecessary use of lethal force by law enforcement that this upcoming police support event being attended by various political leaders, including our own Governor, highlight the need for police accountability in order to prevent future incidents rooted in the disregard of the value of black lives. Governor Walker and others who stand with him have a tremendous opportunity to prove that they are finally listening to the concerns of many around our state who believe that both the Police and the citizens that they serve deserve the chance to live and make it back home to their families. Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill young black man who was shot 14 times by a Milwaukee Police Officer 6 miles from where the event will be held, deserved the chance to make it back home to his family. 



Not recognizing the need for the call for police accountability would be detrimental to the progress that must be made to end the frustrations that many black families have when they, too, worry if their sons and daughters, fathers and mothers will make it back home safely after interaction with Police. This event will probably be used as a political platform to tell a captive Police audience what they may want to hear but it has the potential be used a support platform to tell them what they need to hear. What the whole state needs to hear. That Black Lives must matter and those who advocate for them need their support too.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,

This is the truth behind the Republican lie.  I hope you read it.  Feel free to ask me questions.  I'll be happy to answer!



From one of the comments at the end of the article, which sums it all up nicely:

""All we’ve heard from Walker and the Republican legislators is that overpaid and over benefited public employees were the cause of the budget problems that required Act 10. Looking at these charts those claims weren’t truthful as most of us tried to explain to the people of Wisconsin. All of Walker’s disparaging and denigrating language directed at public employees was not based in fact and were lies designed to turn people against public employees to support his hostile actions. It was all for one reason; to destroy public employee unions by turning people against their public servants in classic “DIVIDE and Conquer!” Later in his reign of terror he did the same thing to private unions. In the process he has driven Wisconsin’s economy, education and environment in to the tank. We are now a low wage, low jobs, low opportunity state with poverty and economic hardship for most becoming the norm.""

"BREAKING NEWS: CHANGES TO WRS REMOVED FROM BUDGET



As many of you know, the JFC approved a measure on Thursday that would make serious changes to the Legislative Committee that oversees the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). Now on its own, this doesn’t sound like much but this provision would remove the lawmakers and public member only to replace them with politicians. In other words, this measure looked like they were preparing to stack the deck in case they want to make changes to the WRS. The Senate just announced that these changes will be removed from the budget entirely and it is my hope that this will also be the case in the Assembly.



----



Well, I hope you all enjoyed the fireworks this weekend because there are fireworks going on inside the Capitol right now. Remember that ‘budget deal’ that was announced on Wednesday that would end the stalemate? It seems to have ignited a bit of a firestorm.



On Thursday, the Joint Finance Committee finally met to finish their work of redrafting the budget. One of the things that happens on the last day of this process is the introduction of “Budget Motion 999.” This is a term for the final catch-all motion for all sorts of items that the JFC decided to add to the budget at the very last minute. It usually passes in the middle of the night and the rest of us wake up to find that something that would never have been approved in the light of day was snuck into the large motion.



And that is exactly what happened in the wee hours of Friday morning.



The JFC voted to make dramatic changes to Wisconsin’s open records law. For those of you who aren’t familiar with this, the open records law allows anyone to request information from their state lawmakers, local officials and their offices. But under this proposal in “Budget Motion 999,” this method of open government and transparency would be sharply curtailed. 



This measure quickly incited a public outcry and all the majority members of the JFC claimed they didn’t know who came up with the idea after they all voted to approve it. And unfortunately, “Budget Motion 999” was written in a way that makes it almost impossible to find out who proposed each change.



On Monday, a Republican member of the JFC publically apologized for his voters for voting for such dramatic changes to our open records law. Apparently he didn’t understand the full scope of what was being proposed. Now, I understand that a lot of what we deliberate in Madison is complicated but it is vital to ensure that you have all the facts before casting a vote in the middle of the night on something that had little to no public input.



After so many people got upset about this measure, it was quickly pulled out of the budget. But that didn’t stop the Assembly leadership from attempting to defend the merits of the proposal. One of them even dropped a swear word during an interview. Like I said, fireworks. 



Thanks to the hundreds of Wisconsinites who wrote, called or emailed with their concerns, this measure is now safely out of the budget. Sometimes “we the people” can make a difference.



So where does this leave us? Well, as we speak, the Senate is debating the budget and the Assembly will take it up tomorrow. This appears to be another sign of a turf war between the Assembly and the Senate as they fight to see who gets to go first. The Senate says they will include a full repeal of the prevailing wage law in the budget, which goes against the deal that was announced on Wednesday to leave it out of the budget entirely. Things are changing so quickly that it is all we can do to try to stay on top of it. 



For those of you who are nerdy like me or wonky enough to want to see some of the nitty gritty numbers behind the budget, check out this memo put together by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau (LFB). It gives a nice rundown of the differences between the budget that the Governor originally proposed back in February and the budget approved by Joint Finance Committee last week.

I first saw Gaelynn play several years ago at the Thirsty Pagan in Superior with Alan Sparhawk of the band Low. Alan is a musical genius and, in my opinion, the most successful musician that the Twin Ports has seen since Bob Dylan. He discovered Gaelynn playing at a local farmers market and asked her if she'd like to play with him in a band called Murder of Crows. Since that time she has worked with Alan and a recently added looping to her repertoire. Last summer I saw her play solo at North Country Independent Living's annual expo and it was evident that she had come a long way since her early days playing with Alan. Her confidence and skill has matured and she now is making uniquely beautiful music that will now be heard by a much wider audience. The Twin Ports is home to a music scene unrivaled by cities of similar populations. I feel very lucky to live here and support these local musicians. I have no doubt that Gaelynn will continue to inspire and grow our local music scene as she brings her talent to the national stage.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Our friend, Donald Ystad of Rome, has another brilliant email out sent to his list of public officials and stakeholders in central Wisconsin. My opponent and all policymakers need to listen to Donald. Not protecting our water is madness.



Fellow concerned citizens,



Many of you attended the citizen meeting in Rome in January when Dr. George Kraft told us we knew a lot about phosphorous in our water, quite a bit about nitrates in our water, but very little about the effect of pesticides in our water. He said the science isn't there yet, especially where it concerns the complex mix of chemicals in many pesticides.



I think you should read this, and be aware where our groundwater recharge area is.  It is east and north towards Town of Grant, Leola, and Plainfield, some of the most heavily cropped acreage in the area, and the area where we've seen hundreds of acres clear cut and converted to crop fields this year. I don't mean to alarm you, but this article talks of Atrizine showing up in drinking water 20 years after it was banned. It also talks of politicians trying to reverse it's ban stating it would be a hardship on farmers, even though it is completely banned in Europe. It would be interesting to follow the money and see who contributes to these politicians campaigns.  Wisconsin’s current groundwater law does not set a standard for total pesticides in water, nor is there a standard set nationally by the EPA. The European Union’s standard is 0.5 ppb.



What do we do? In Rome, about 1/3 of us are on Rome municipal water. They test every three years for things like pesticides and are scheduled for a full cycle next year. For all of us who may be concerned about the lack of control of these chemicals and the effect on our groundwater, we need to express our concern to DATCP, the Department of Trade and Consumer Protection, benbrancel@wisconsin.gov & Stan.Senger@wisconsin.gov, and to the DNR, as they also conclude we have an issue with pesticides, cathy.stepp@wisconsin.gov. While politicians are blowing in their ear to induce them to loosen restrictions, we need to be in their other ear, reminding them who they work for.

We are proposing to remove the Governor’s changes to FamilyCare and IRIS, but directing DHS to apply for a federal waiver for changes on FamilyCare to integrate long-term care and medical care.  The proposal will be required to include:

- Require public and stakeholder input before any changes are made.

- Require self-directed care with budget authority, to be defined in statute.

- Require a regional model with multiple Integrated Health Agencies (IHA) per region.

- Require an independent actuarial study to set rates.

- Require the acceptance of “any willing provider” for a multi-year transition.

 -Preserve ADRC services.

- Require final approval of any waiver application by the Joint Finance Committee before submission to the Federal Government.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"IN-DISTRICT TOWN HALLS:

With the budget finished and the fall legislative session right around the corner, I will be holding four town hall meetings to receive feedback from constituents and to answer any questions or concerns they may have.



Earlier this year, I was able to hold several listening sessions which focused on the budget. Those listening sessions were very useful to me over the course of the budget process and I trust these town halls will prove just as helpful for the upcoming fall session. I encourage residents of the Fox Cities to attend and if anyone is unable, you are always welcome to contact me by phone, email, or letter.



I will be available to meet with constituents at the locations and times listed below:



Town of Menasha Listening Session #1

Where: Town of Menasha Town Hall, Town Council Chambers, 2000 Municipal Drive, Neenah

When: Thursday, August 27th from 5:00-6:00pm

Where: Neenah Library, Shattuck Room, 240 East Wisconsin Avenue, Neenah

When: Saturday, August 29th from 10:00-11:00am

Experts researching it's use for treating Post Traumatic Stress are seeing highly favorable outcomes. And many veteran's suffering from this disorder are  reporting that it has helped them alleviate their suicidal thoughts. The negative effects often reported when using pharmaceutical drugs are also non existent. Shouldn't our goal be to provide our fellow man with the most effective, least harmful treatments for illness?

The form will remain open for public comment until 12:00 a.m. February 1, 2015.

While the public input form provides an opportunity to submit feedback online, nine public hearings will also be held throughout Wisconsin over the next week. Hearing dates and locations are as follows - each will run from 6-8 p.m.:



Tuesday, Jan. 20

• La Crosse - DNR Service Center, Room B19, 3550 Mormon Coulee Road

• Fitchburg - DNR Service Center, Gathering Waters Conference Room, 3911 Fish Hatchery Road. 



Wednesday, Jan. 21

• Dodgeville - DNR Service Center, Conference Room, 1500 N. Johns St. 



Thursday, Jan. 22

• Chippewa Falls - Chippewa Valley Technical College Business Education Center, Room 103A, 620 West Clairemont Ave.

• Green Bay - Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, Lecture Hall Room SC132, 2740 W. Mason St.

• Schofield - DC Everest Middle School, Auditorium, 9302 Schofield Ave. 



Monday, Jan. 26

• Waukesha - DNR Service Center, Room 151 (West entrance), 141 NW Barstow St.; and 

• Spooner - Spooner DNR Service Center, Community Room, 810 West Maple St. 



Tuesday, Jan. 27

• Rhinelander - James Williams Middle School auditorium, 915 Acacia Lane. 



The Natural Resources Board will consider feedback submitted online, along with comments from January public hearings, when making its final decision on the proposed permanent rule package on Feb. 25. If approved, the rule package will advance to the state legislature for final review.



For more information regarding hearing locations and the Deer Trustee Report, visit dnr.wi.gov and search keywords ""hearings"" and ""deer trustee report"" respectively.

"Today I released the following statement in light of recent killings of black citizens at the hands of Law Enforcement in Wisconsin and around the Country and the shooting attack on Dallas police officers and protesters last night: 



“At times there are clear reasons to give up hope that we as a community and a nation might treat Black citizens equally and equitably to their White brothers and sisters who engage with law enforcement and live on to make it back home to their families. Whether it’s a conversation, a verbal warning, a ticket, or an arrest, every person deserves the chance to get to that next step in the process. The same goes for officers who are committed to serving our residents. Every time they clock in for a shift, they deserve the chance to clock out and return to their families. No one deserves to have his or her life taken in situations that can be prevented with other courses of action.



“This could be one of those times. We all are contemplating if this is too hard to solve and heal. But giving up means giving up on ourselves and the brighter and better future our community and our country deserve. This added trauma and heightened tension prevents us from building authentic, positive relationships between our communities of color and law enforcement committed to the safekeeping of our community.



“Just two weeks ago Jay Anderson, a 25 year old black man, was sitting in his car in a suburban Milwaukee park when he was approached by a police officer who shot him to death after seeing a gun in the car. On Tuesday Alton Sterling, a 37 year old black man from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was shot to death while pinned down on the ground and a gun was discovered. And on Wednesday in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota Philando Castile, a 32 year old black man, was pulled over on a routine traffic stop for a broken tail light and shot to death with a child and girlfriend in the car.



“At the same time, last night’s horrific situation in Dallas of 12 Police Officers & 2 protesters injured from a shooting attack that left five officers dead is another obstacle that keeps us from working and engaging in dialogue with each other. This is not what we need.



“Real, authentic relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve will be built if we rise above the pressure to give up and focus on addressing problems and distractions. Clearly, we can’t afford not to any longer.



“I pray for all the families and all heavy hearts hurt from these situations. May God help us.”

"""And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared."" - Homer



I knew field organizer Kyle Welton was someone special the first time I met him, and he recited from memory a long passage from Homer's The Illiad. He studied it at Marquette, Kyle explained, and the Greek classic has inspired him ever since.



Thanks to Kyle's persuasive, non-stop recruiting, dozens (hundreds?) of Sheboygan area Dems are spending thousands of hours on the phone, on the streets and in public places everywhere, telling voters what's at stake in this election. It's a larger and more enthusiastic group than I've ever seen here, and it's beautiful. 



I'm grateful to those who secured the finding to open two local offices and to hire Kyle, who has turned both places into such hotbeds of activity.



I stopped in on a recent evening and watched him make a few of his recruiting calls.  The place was deserted at that late hour, but there he was, making call after call. His goal is 200 calls every night, he told me. This takes a minimum of four hours.



Thanks, Kyle, for working all those hours, and for inspiring me to make my own calls. I can't top 200, but I'll do what can, and I won't give up.  



It's never been more important for Progressives to think great thoughts. And nobly dare.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I said I would write my thoughts on the events around Sherman Park and the hours I spent there yesterday and last night, here it is:



Bricks and Energy. 



The same energy that's used to pick up a brick, and throw it through a window is...

The same energy that's used to pick up a brick, and put it on top of another brick lined with mortar. 

The same energy that's used to destroy is...

The same energy that's used to build.



My Rabbi once told me anger is favorable to depression because depression is not only a lack of energy, but an active void sucking energy into a blackhole of nothingness. Whereas Anger is energy, true enough manifesting itself in a negative way, but energy nonetheless. That energy has the potential to be transformed into something positive, and in that there lies hope.



As I was driving back to the Sherman Park area, well...I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel nervous. I heard stuff was getting tense and might be poppin off real soon, but this is my city, my community and if it's suffering I'm suffering too. I texted some friends so they knew exactly where I was, I called another friend who was over there and he told me ""Just be careful, you're white and some people are being irrationally violent"". As I drove up I saw the cops in full force, I saw the lights blaring, and the crowds waiting for something to happen, it was getting ready to potentially go down. 



I parked on Sherman, off of Burleigh, and looked around...I saw lots of guns with fingers on triggers, lots of military-looking gear, lots of scared, curious, angry, and tired people. I saw a group of dudes walk by me, eye me up, and say something like ""We burning this MF to the ground tonight."" Then the group marching west down Burleigh showed up and they came to the intersection. Lots of ""No Justice No Peace"" chants and ""Whose Streets? Our Streets!"". After a few mins things started getting a little hairy.. There was a small group (I don't think more than 30 or so of the 500 plus people who were there) that started throwing rocks, bottles, and bricks. It was at this point the police really went into action. Bus load after bus load from north and south of Burleigh on Sherman started showing up and unloading heavily armored cops. More stuff was thrown (I almost got hit a few times) and the crowd started dispersing quickly. We went across the street, out of the target area, and I met up with some other friends, reporters, onlookers, community members, and neighborhood leaders and we watched, talked, and waited together. 



We then walked further down to see what was going on a little bit west of us, and ran into another friend who happens to be a DJ, and he kept saying how he just is seeing more and more friends out tonight. I mentioned that in another context, with those cop lights as strobe lights, his equipment instead of the cops blow-horns and all our friends out here this could be a very different night. He got it right away and we briefly entertained the idea of a late night block party and what that could look like.

That's just the point, isn't it? The energy there was unmistakable and heavy in the air...BUT that same energy could be a ""riot"" or a block party, a window being smashed or a home being built. We can try and repress the energy, try and lock more people up, instill more curfews, penalize people further, and try to depress that energy, OR we can engage our community and our youth, work to TRANSFORM that energy into something greater, something positive, and something we can all be proud of. 



Instead of the hate, the finger pointing, and the anger, let's work to elevate our community and the energy within it for something greater than what we are seeing now.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mayor Barrett and the Milwaukee Common Council vote today on the Streetcar project. Yesterday, I wrote them to express the importance of voting in favor of its development.



The construction and operation of the Streetcar would provide both short and long term job creation for our community. The bulk of the capital needed to grow this project will be provided through federal funding sources and would be passed to other states or cities if not utilized here. 

 

The Streetcar will attract a fresh workforce and new businesses. It provides another environmentally friendly option to satisfy our city’s transportation needs and a safe ride option for people returning home after community events. 

 

I support the proposed Streetcar because it makes sense as part of a larger growth strategy for Milwaukee. I hope today's vote is in favor of this valuable investment.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"LAB and Audit Committee Are Important for Legislative Oversight



MADISON – Today, the co-chairpersons of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee responded to a legislative proposal that would eliminate the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau (LAB) and the Joint Legislative Audit Committee by indicating their strong support for and confidence in the quality work of LAB and the professionalism of LAB staff.



Through its audit work with the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, LAB supports the Legislature’s oversight of state agencies by identifying instances or patterns of fraud, statutory noncompliance, waste, and mismanagement. LAB identifies ways state agencies can achieve cost savings and realize efficiencies. LAB also provides policy analysis to inform legislative action on specific programs or more generally across state government.



“For nearly 50 years, audits performed by the Legislative Audit Bureau have been a legislative ‘check’ on state agencies and programs,” said Representative Samantha Kerkman (R-Salem).  That the Audit Bureau performs its work externally to state agencies and in a non-partisan manner is crucial to its findings and to the value we place in its work.”



LAB identifies concerns, areas for cost savings, and policy information through its Fraud, Waste, and Mismanagement Hotline, which protects the identity of informants by statute.



“The non-partisan Legislative Audit Bureau is an invaluable resource to the Legislature and to the people of the state,” said Sen. Robert Cowles. “Our auditors provide insight and proactive recommendations to the Legislature and state agencies that help to protect Wisconsin taxpayers by locating cost saving measures and efficiencies.”



Senator Robert Cowles and Representative Samantha Kerkman (R-Salem), co-chairpersons of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, produced a list of selected noteworthy findings from LAB audits, which accompanies this press release.



More information about the work of LAB and the Joint Legislative Audit Committee is available at www.legis.wisconsin.gov/lab.

The state’s hiring process will be more effective and top-quality employees can receive merit-pay bonuses. Employees will clearly know what actions are cause for immediate dismissal, and the appeals process will be streamlined. This bill builds off of the foundation established by Governor La Follette back in 1905 when he signed civil service protections into law in order to ensure that the best are serving our state.” 



“I am pleased that the final version of this bill contains a provision to “Ban the Box.” This means that the state will be prohibited from asking a job applicant to identify a conviction record as part of their application process, unless a conviction record disqualifies applicants from a civil service position. I believe that a job candidate should be judged on qualifications first, without the stigma of a conviction record, and the hiring process should be flexible enough to consider the circumstances involved and whether the former conviction relates to the job.”

"Here is some important new information from the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development with regards to Disability Insurance:



Starting this week, the Division of Unemployment Insurance (UI), in order help more UI claimants transition back to employment quickly and meet employers' demand for talent, will revise its current system of waiving work-search requirements for claimants who expect recall from their employers. 



Highlights of the revisions include:



•	Claimants who expect recall by their employer may seek a waiver of the weekly work-search requirement for an 8-week period that can be extended for a maximum of 4 additional weeks with verification from the claimant's employer. Currently, waivers are approved through the end of a benefit year for a claimant who is not recalled.



•	The weeks of Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's will no longer be automatically waived for work search.



•	Claimants who will start work with a new employer within 4 weeks will  need to provide employer verification in order to obtain a work search waiver.  Employer verification is not currently required in these cases.



•	Claimants working part time for a customary employer (an employer for which the claimant works for more than 4 weeks or the claimant worked at least 32 hours during a given week) will have their work search waived, but will be required to register with Wisconsin Job Service through JobCenterofWisconsin.com and build a Job Match Profile.  This requirement is not currently in place for those with work search waivers.



These changes implement revisions to Chapter 126 and 127 of Wisconsin Administrative Code that the Legislature requested during the most recent legislative session.  DWD has now put in place the technology and operational framework to carry out these new requirements. 



As you are aware, UI claimants must be able to work, be available for work, and conduct a search for work when required. While the work search requirement may be waived when certain conditions are met under state law, such waivers are the exception, not the rule.  You also find more information about the work-search waiver online at  ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"There is nobody more qualified to lead us in the 67th Assembly District. 



As a retired United States Air Force Officer, Dennis led countless troops overseas as well as at home defending our country and responsibly managing federal funds trusted to his care. 



Dennis has a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting from the University of San Diego and a Master's Degree in Organization Management from The George Washington University. 



Dennis has also tirelessly volunteered throughout the 67th District. You will find him at the baseball fields coaching either football or baseball, in his Scout Leader uniform leading our youth, or at church helping balance the budget or pouring beer for charity at Oktoberfest or the McDonell Alumni Basketball Tournament. 



Dennis is a man of integrity who cares about his hometown. He will be our voice in Madison and will vote his conscience on our behalf. 



Are you ready for this?

As a former Texas Police Officer, just north of Dallas, I am heartbroken by the needless and senseless killings of the police officers who were doing their jobs and protecting the public. Any loss of life in this manner is a waste, and somehow, we as Americans need to come together and realize violence is never the answer. 



When an officer is killed in the line of duty, fellow officers wear a bland or mourning band over their badges to honor the fallen officer. Today I wear a band over my heart grieving for all the families involved and praying for those who were shot and injured, that they may recover.

"Democracy. It's the foundation of America. Wars are fought in its name. The concept is simple; people elect representatives and those representatives work for the people. 



Everyone seems to agree that the system is no longer working. Profiteers and their complicit politicians have rigged the game. Travis Tranel may have been one of us when he was first elected but he rapidly became a pawn of the profiteers. 



Tranel is a member of ALEC, The American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC is literally corporations writing laws. Their complicit politicians then “author” and vote for the legislation. ...And guess who donates huge sums of money to their campaigns. Travis has introduced, co-sponsored, and voted for numerous ALEC bills. He is, quite simply, not working for us.



I believe in democracy. I will never quit fighting for “of the people, for the people, by the people."" Help me fight these corrupt politicians and their ""profits over people"" agenda.

"Thank you to Senator Bernie Sanders for all that you have done for our party. Your vision of a progressive revolution has inspired millions of Americans to think big again. Your call to action has created a grassroots revolution-- the likes of which we have not seen in a generation. You are my inspiration and a brilliant example of who a true public servant should be.



You have put aside your own ego numerous times throughout your life for the good of the whole. Without your influence and willingness to work for a cause rather than yourself, you have begun the healing process after a long primary process. Your fight for a progressive platform and your resounding endorsement of Hillary Clinton proves your dedication to our cause and we will do well to remember that as we move forward.



While we have undoubtedly begun the progressive movement within the party, we recognize that there is still a long road ahead of us. This path may be long, but we have your example of four decades of public service to follow. Your examples of compromise and cooperation serve as important reminders as we begin our work with Secretary Clinton and her campaign to bring progressive politics back to the foreground of America.



From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for your unrelenting passion and dedication from your earliest days of service to your future endeavors. I pray that one day I will look back on my life and know that I was able to bring even one-tenth of the positive change to the world that you have.



So thank you for running, for being an example, and for inspiring me to dream big again.

Tourism Secretary Stephanie Klett shared some exciting news during her address. All counties saw an increase in tourism dollars spent in 2015. Statewide, we have 187,000 tourism employees. In 2015, we saw an eight to one return on tourism dollars invested by the state. The halo effect is real: visitors with a great experience are more likely to come to Wisconsin for college, career, vacation, or retirement. And most importantly, Sec. Klett told us that Wisconsin's tourism focus is all about telling people about the FUN you can have in Wisconsin.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public meeting for Belknap Street in the city of Superior

Meeting to focus on preparations for the reconstruction of Belknap Street



The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) Northwest Region in Superior is announcing a public meeting to discuss the reconstruction of US 2, Belknap Street from Banks Avenue to Hill Avenue. WisDOT, in partnership with the City of Superior, will be holding the meeting on Thursday November 3, 2016.  There are two opportunities to attend this meeting; 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Both meetings will be held at Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College – Superior, Conference Center – Room C108, 600 N 21st Street, Superior, WI 54880.



This meeting will provide an update to the public on the project schedule, detours, access, local traffic through construction, and construction staging.  The improvement project on US 2, Belknap Street begins just west of the Banks Avenue intersection, continues east on Belknap Street, and ends west of the E. 7th Street intersection. Most of the connecting side streets would be reconstructed to the alleys, north and south of Belknap Street.   



Construction will begin in the spring of 2017, and is scheduled for two construction seasons, both 2017 and 2018.  The US 2, Belknap Street roadway will be reconstructed in separate construction zones and stages.  



WisDOT and City of Superior representatives will be available to discuss the construction project.  Superior Business Improvement District and The Chamber & Visitors Bureau - Superior-Douglas County Area staff plan to be present.  All interested residents and property owners are encouraged to attend the meeting, ask questions, and prepare for construction.  Citizens who are hearing-impaired and require an interpreter may request one by contacting the Wisconsin Telecommunication Relay System (TTY) at 1.800.947.3529. 



For additional information about the project, please visit the project website:  ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a mark of respect for the memory of Nancy Reagan, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment.  I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

That's nearly as many ""likes"" in 5 months as the incumbent has received in the last 6 years. Individual posts have received over 9000 ""likes"" and over 1000 ""shares."" 



There is clearly something special about this campaign. It has us poised to win. It's not me. It's not some secret strategy. It is simply our message. 



We are all sick of politicians working for their donors rather than working for us. We all know that if we are to have a just and sustainable future- economically, socially, and environmentally, we need representatives that will fight for it rather than working to maximize campaign contributions. 



As far as the individual issues, I'm no fool. I know that very few of us will agree on every issue. I also know that, until we get rid of these bought-and-paid-for politicians, we have very little power to fundamentally address any of the individual issues. 



I will never quit fighting to end this current ""legal bribery,"" anti-democratic, anti-American brand of governance. I will fight to restore government ""Of the people, By the people, For the people."" Nothing I do will be driven by political-expediency but rather by what I judge to be best for our district and our shared future. 



Keep Sharing!

Douglas County considering outsourcing juvenile detention out of state



Posted on Mar 24, 2015 at 12:46 p.m.

Danielle Kaeding, Wisconsin Public Radio



A northern Wisconsin county is considering housing juvenile offenders in Minnesota because they are struggling to meet standards on where minors can be held.



Douglas County Administrator Andy Lisak said the Sheriff’s Department could contract with a juvenile detention center in Duluth.



“What we’re currently doing is transporting juveniles down to a detention center in Eau Claire,” Lisak said.



Jail Administrator Robert Galovich said that's because the county jail doesn’t meet regulations for housing young people.



“They don’t meet the criteria of being out of sight, out of the area. They need to be completely isolated,” Galovich said.



That's one of the requirements states must meet to receive federal incentive money, according to information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Justice. It's part of an effort to get facilities to comply with federal standards. The idea is that separating juveniles limits exposure to threats or abuse from adult offenders.

"Starting today, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) is scheduled to close the entrance ramp from WIS 50 to US 12 westbound, in Walworth County. The closure is expected to last through the evening hours of Thursday, May 21. 

This closure will affect the morning commute on May 12 through the evening commute on May 21. 

This work is part of the US 12/WIS 50 project which began in spring of 2014. This closure was not originally anticipated to complete the work on this ramp. However, crews since discovered the condition of the pavement on the ramp has deteriorated beyond the point of economical repair. This will require more intensive work on the ramp which requires it to be shut down to traffic. 

Detour for WIS 50 westbound motorists: 

•	Proceed through the US 12/WIS 50 Interchange to access Edwards Blvd.

•	Go north on Edwards Blvd., continuing as it turns into Sheridan Springs Road.

•	Continue west on Sheridan Springs Road to County H (Interchange North Road). 

•	Go east on County H to access the US 12 westbound on-ramp at the WIS 120 Interchange.

The contractor will take advantage of the closure by performing other work items on the ramp that were to take place over several weeks of night time closures.  

 

WisDOT has scheduled this closure to occur prior to the Memorial Day weekend, in an attempt to limit disruption to traffic related to the summer tourist season.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Judge Peterson also overturned a law that extended Wisconsin's residency requirement from 10 days to 28, and another that created tough barriers to students using their school IDs to vote. These laws were nothing more than an effort to suppress the vote in certain districts and I applaud this decision to overturn them.

EAB Found in Sawyer County; Quarantine in Process

Contact: Donna Gilson, 608-224-5130



MADISON – Emerald ash borer has been found in Sawyer County, the second most northern location in Wisconsin to date. The county will be quarantined.



""This new infestation is concerning, because it's getting to our North Woods, less than 20 miles from the Chequamegon National Forest and the adjoining Flambeau River State Forest. But it's not

surprising, given the ease with which this pest can hitchhike with the help of humans,"" said Brian Kuhn, director of the Bureau of Plant Industry in the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and

Consumer Protection. ""Fortunately, the infestation appears to be in a very early stage, with no damage apparent yet, and even though it's in a heavily wooded area, very few of the trees are ash.""



Only ash trees are susceptible to the destructive beetle.



A single adult beetle was found in a monitoring trap set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of its national survey for EAB. The trap was set along North Eastlund Road in the Town of Radisson.



The quarantine will apply to all of Sawyer County. It prohibits ash wood products and hardwood firewood from being moved out of the county to areas that are not infested. For private citizens, this

means that they cannot take firewood from Sawyer County to non-quarantine counties. For businesses handling wood products that could carry EAB, it means that they must work with DATCP or the USDA to assure that their products are pest-free before shipping.



DATCP recommends that property owners who have ash trees in quarantine counties:

-Keep a close watch on ash trees for signs of possible EAB infestation: Thinning in the canopy, D-shaped holes in the bark, new branches sprouting low on the trunk, cracked bark, and

woodpeckers pulling at the bark to get to insect larvae beneath it.

-Consider preventive treatments if your property is within 15 miles of a known infestation. Whether to treat depends on the age, size and number of ash trees. Treatment costs vary depending on size of the tree and whether you do the treatments yourself or hire a professional.

-Consider planting different species of trees that are not susceptible to EAB.

-Call a professional arborist for expert advice, and visit emeraldashborer.wi.gov for detailed information.



Emerald ash borer is native to China and probably entered the United States on packing material, showing up first in Michigan in 2002. It was first found in Wisconsin in 2008 in Washington County.

Sawyer County will join 38 other Wisconsin counties where EAB has been found: Adams, Brown, Buffalo, Calumet, Columbia, Crawford, Dane, Dodge, Door, Douglas, Fond du Lac, Grant, Green, Jackson, Jefferson, Juneau, Kenosha, La Crosse, Lafayette, Marquette, Milwaukee, Monroe, Oneida, Outagamie, Ozaukee, Portage, Racine, Richland, Rock, Sauk, Sheboygan, Trempealeau, Vernon,

Walworth, Washington, Waukesha, Winnebago and Wood. Iowa, Kewaunee and Manitowoc counties are also under quarantine because of the proximity of infestations in neighboring counties.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a shame and extremely disappointing that at the state level earlier today, the entire Assembly Republican Caucus voted to intentionally harm the role of this organization and the services it provides to women, men, and teenagers in our state.

"Another misleading column from Gov. Walker, this time about the state's vital yet increasingly neglected infrastructure. 



For example, he says that ""97 percent of our most heavily traveled highways are rated in fair or above fair condition,"" which is his justification for underfunding transportation by billions of dollars over the next decade. According to my colleague Rep. Robb Kahl, the ""most heavily traveled highways"" Walker talks about make up only 1.4 percent of our road system. Overall, the U.S. Department of Transportation ranks Wisconsin as the state with the third-worst roads in the nation, with 71 percent of roads in poor or mediocre condition. 



We need to address our crumbling infrastructure immediately, not continue to kick the can down a road full of potholes.

"I grew up in a working class neighborhood on the South Side of Milwaukee.   I spent most of my free time at the Boy’s Club where I participated in competitive weight lifting and swimming, community service, archery and many more activities.  The Boy’s Club played a large part in shaping my character, and it taught me that non family caring adults can have a significant positive impact on the lives of youth.

I delivered the Milwaukee Journal   at the age of 12, and continued to work at part time jobs throughout my teenage years.  Since the age of twelve, I was responsible for buying my own clothes.

Due to living in a highly dysfunctional household, my high school academic career was poor. I did excel in both athletics and student leadership.  I was a three time city of Milwaukee wrestling champion and placed fifth in state my senior year. I was also both a high school and adult men’s state power lifting champion during my high school years.  I was my homeroom’s Student Council Representative all four years and held the office of Executive Committee Person in my junior year.

Upon graduating from Milwaukee Technical HS in 1974, I worked as a landscaper, dish washer, and insecticide sprayer in Florida. In 1976, I returned to Milwaukee where I worked for Instant Help, a temp job service, and I attended MATC through a CETA secretarial program.  After graduating, I enrolled at UW Richland Center where I studied and wrestled for two years.  I transferred to UW La Crosse and in 1983 earned a BS in K-12 Physical Education and Health Educational. After graduating, I worked for one year as a substitute teacher and homebound instructor for the school district of La Crosse.

From 1985-1988, I worked in La Paz, Bolivia at the American Corporative School as the Sport Facility Director and the Elementary Physical Education Instructor. 

From 1988-1990, I pursued my master’s degree in K-12 Counseling at UW-Superior.  After graduating, I worked for two years as a High School/Middle School Counselor at Nido de Aguilas International School in Santiago, Chile.  

In August of 1992, I was hired by the Nekoosa School District.  Throughout my tenure, I chaired numerous committees and played a major role in the establishment of Nekoosa’s Alternative School, High School Summer School Program, and Credit Recovery Program.   Due to my wife receiving a diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer’s, I took early retirement at the age of 55. My Chilean wife Rosario wanted to be near her son in Chile, so we move there in September of 2011, but we had to return in 9 months due to health insurance problems and the lack of supportive services.

Currently, with the help of Community Care Connect Wisconsin, I am the primary care giver for my wife who is now in the late stages of Alzheimer’s.  



I want to represent the 72nd in order to:

 

-help Wisconsin’s excellent public schools get even better, and find real solutions for impoverished students who struggle to learn.

-help existing Wisconsin businesses to prosper, while attracting new businesses to the state. 

-help find additional ways to exploit our world class university system in developing innovations that lead to more jobs for Wisconsinites. 

-bring creative ideas for improving state run social programs.

-develop policies that create a strong middle class.

-bring pragmatic independent problem solving skills to Madison.

I believe:

-having a strong middle class is a decision made by society.

-Public Schools are the bedrock of Democracy, and I believe that publicly funding private schools will be detrimental to our public schools, and will lead to greater division and strife among our citizens.

-all people can develop, and we need to invest in people.

-hope comes from a positive vision of the future.

-no one person is smarter than the collective effort of a diverse group.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As 2015 begins to come to a close, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities that I have had over the past year. It was a pleasure to serve the constituents of the 99th Assembly District over the past four years, and I am enjoying the opportunity to continue serving them, as well as our neighbors in the 97th and 98th Assembly Districts, as your senator.



As Abraham Lincoln once said, ""We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven; we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown."" Let us all give thanks for our blessings and enjoy our fellowship this Thanksgiving Day.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sen. Risser appointed to serve on Educational Communications Board

 

MADISON – Senator Fred Risser (D-Madison) has been appointed to serve on the Educational Communications Board (ECB) Board of Directors by Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). The ECB is a state agency responsible for distributing K-12 educational media, public safety alerts and public broadcasting services to Wisconsin’s citizens. The ECB Board of Directors oversees efforts to improve telecommunication services across Wisconsin and leverage technology to enhance education opportunities. 



“Sen. Risser is an outspoken advocate for public broadcasting and brings a wealth of experience and leadership to the ECB Board,” said Sen. Shilling. “At a time when our schools and communities are facing difficult new challenges, Sen. Risser’s commitment to education opportunities and support for public infrastructure will be an asset to the ECB Board and its mission.”



""Wisconsin Public Broadcasting provides a vital service to its listeners and viewers,"" said Sen. Risser. ""I am honored to be selected to serve on the Educational Communications Board and look forward to further expanding and improving its availability to all Wisconsin citizens.""



Additional information about the ECB and the services it provides can be found online at www.ecb.org.

Hundreds of people showed up for this public hearing and the board only allotted 30 minutes for public testimony. I have never seen an elected body more unwilling to listen to the community that they are elected to represent. 



Allegations of widespread bullying have led the Spooner community to lose all faith in the school board. The recent mass exodus of teachers and staff wiped out 1000 years of institutional knowledge and experience. A huge number of kids have open-enrolled to get out of this district. Over 30 teachers in attendance stood up to acknowledge that they have felt bullied in the previous year. #SpoonerProud deserves better.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Court is moving beyond their role of constitutional review and is acting as a super-legislature denying Wisconsin legislators the ability to enact laws on behalf of their constituents.”

"From History.com: 



Following approval of statehood by the territory’s citizens, Wisconsin enters the Union as the 30th state.



In 1634, French explorer Jean Nicolet landed at Green Bay, becoming the first European to visit the lake-heavy northern region that would later become Wisconsin. In 1763, at the conclusion of the French and Indian Wars, the region, a major center of the American fur trade, passed into British control. Two decades later, at the end of the American Revolution, the region came under U.S. rule and was governed as part of the Northwest Territory. However, British fur traders continued to dominate Wisconsin from across the Canadian border, and it was not until the end of the War of 1812 that the region fell firmly under American control.



In the first decades of the 19th century, settlers began arriving via the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes to exploit Wisconsin’s agricultural potential, and in 1832 the Black Hawk War ended Native American resistance to white settlement. In 1836, after several decades of governance as part of other territories, Wisconsin was made a separate entity, with Madison, located midway between Milwaukee and the western centers of population, marked as the territorial capital. By 1840, population in Wisconsin had risen above 130,000, but the people voted against statehood four times, fearing the higher taxes that would come with a stronger central government. Finally, in 1848, Wisconsin citizens, envious of the prosperity that federal programs brought to neighboring Midwestern states, voted to approve statehood. Wisconsin entered the Union the next May.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Three Walleye Limit Proposed for 2015 Season on Northern Lakes 



The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has announced a proposal for a daily bag limit of three walleye for the season on most waters in northern Wisconsin.  The proposal, which affects only walleye, will be considered by the Natural Resources Board at its next meeting on April 8.  If it is approved by the DNR Board, it will still be subject to a public hearing and comment process.



The three walleye decision was reached to manage the population of sport fish in northern waters in the Ceded Territory and establish certainty for anglers.  DNR officials considered the number of fish that will be harvested by recreational anglers and by spearfishing in the Ceded Territory.  In recent years, tribal spearfishing has resulted in fewer fish harvested than predicted, which has caused DNR to adjust bag limits for other anglers at different points throughout the fishing season.  This has caused confusion and uncertainty.  The new three walleye daily limit for the 2015 season will be a consistent number that anglers can count on as they go out on the water. 



Detailed information about fishing guidelines on all lakes can be easily found through the DNR’s official Fish and Wildlife Guide mobile app, which is available for iPhone and Android.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My speech from the floor:



‘Twas the day before the big vote and all through our house,

The Ds talked so long it made the Rs grouse.

But as we have heard – this is your bill!

Though written by ALEC, you claim ownership still.



But why debate this bill, the budget is nigh,

What will this do to help unemployment so high?

Our budget, our budget, that’s what’s the matter

That’s the topic that’s arose such a clatter.



SeniorCare cut, leaving thousands off care, 

In hopes they would sign for Part D Medicare,

The UW was slashed, filling everyone with dread.

While visions of Minnesota danced in their heads.



My budget, my budget – anything else is a distraction,

Said Governor Walker, our state’s main attraction.

But during our distraction focused on this flap,

We realized suddenly we’d walked into a trap.



With provisions that harmed our dreams and our hopes,

It seemed like his budget was suddenly on the ropes.

When out of the blue there arose such a clatter,

Right to Work had arrived with such a big splatter.



Soon we all knew we had something to dread,

We had let bipartisan promises go right to our head.

They spoke barely a word, but went straight to their work,

Forcing us all into action, even the Chief Clerk.



No more talk of the budget that would hurt the middle class,

No more talk of a tax cut to give us some cash.

This brand new proposal, from just days ago

Gave rise to protests the cold weather couldn’t slow.



But where did this come from? Who sponsored this bill?

Where are our leaders to clean up this great spill?

Then off in Iowa our Governor did appear

Saying send me this bill, I’ll sign it right here!



But where did this come from, who sponsored this bill?

Who gets the credit for the unions it will kill?

Now the rules of our body say we can’t use our names.

Just like “No signs in the gallery” – it’s one of our games.



But how can we give credit where credit is due?

The best I can do is give you a clue.

WMC brought the bill, we know they’re the boss.

They cried, “On ALEC, on Walker, on Fitzgerald on --- he who must not be named!”



It started in the Senate with a hearing cut short,

Due to threats of danger or violence of some sort.

Once the gavel was banged, they were all through.

No one could talk, not even Cindy Loo Who.



Then it was straight to the floor – not a moment’s delay,

Where our Senators put in what they considered a long day.

They didn’t last long, not even past ten.

Our caucus has voted – we’re going longer than them.



On to the Assembly our hearing followed soon,

Where dozens of speakers filled up two whole rooms.

This time things went better, n’ere a one was thrown out.

(But we did have a few who decided to shout).



All kidding aside, we are actually quite grateful,

To have an exec, on that we’re so thankful.

To bring up amendments is something we do, 

But here on the floor, it’s something you eschew.



But party line votes left the amendments on the floor,

With all the work we put in, we had hoped for some more.

More cooperation, bipartisanship and common ground,

At the end of the day, I guess it couldn’t be found.



But back to the bill and the damage it will do.

I’ve heard from lots of people – I know you have too.

From small business owners, contractors and crews,

You call it workplace freedom, but they want freedom too.



If an employer wants a union, why should they be denied,

A label that says, “Made by a union with pride”?

Pitting one group against another is so very wrong

As Rodney King once said, “why can’t we all get along?”



Though the debate will continue, we know how it ends.

To the victor go the spoils is the message it sends.

But what about the rest of us, the beleaguered middle class?

If we ask for our fair share, you say kiss my ___



Ass-suming you’re serious about our taxpayers,

Then heed this advice from Uncle Steve the Soothsayer.

It’s not all that hard, it’s really not a riddle,

Just try to remember the folks in the middle.



Mr. Speaker, I say, we’ve heard it all before,

The middle class of Wisconsin can’t take it no more.

They’ve been working so hard to provide for their own,

But now it feels like we are trying to drive them from home.



So we sit in this chamber hour after hour

With all of our speeches getting no more than a glower.

We want to debate, we want to discuss,

We don’t want to stay up all night just making a fuss.



But the people back home keep writing us letters,

Asking us please, please make our state better.

They tell us their stories about their love of this state,

About conservation and education and other things great.



There are more important things that demand our attention,

And more without rhymes that I couldn’t even mention.

This bill is a distraction and a frustrating attempt,

To lure us away from a budget unkempt.



We should all be at home snuggled up in our beds, 

With thoughts of bipartisanship dancing in our heads.

But as it sits now, there’s no end in sight,

Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, it’s going to be a long night.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Milroy Sworn-In for Fourth Term in State Assembly



MADISON- Representative Nick Milroy (D-South Range) was sworn in today for the 2015-2016 legislative session at the State Capitol in Madison. Conducting the inaugural ceremony was Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, the first woman to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and its first female Chief Justice. Milroy has represented the 73rd Assembly District since 2009. 



“I am honored that the people of the 73rd Assembly District have again entrusted me to represent them in the State Assembly, and I look forward to working with my fellow legislators on both sides of the aisle to craft legislation that will move Wisconsin forward,” said Milroy. “As always, helping working families, protecting Wisconsin’s natural areas, and strengthening our state’s economy are among my top priorities. I will continue to do all I can to ensure that the voices of the people of Northwestern Wisconsin are heard in Madison.”

 

Rep. Milroy is assigned to four committees for the 2015-2016 legislative session. He will serve as Democratic ranking member of the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources and Sporting Heritage and the Committee on Mining and Rural Development, and he has seats on the Committee on Environment and Forestry and the Committee on Veterans and Military Affairs. Milroy will also continue to serve on the Sporting Heritage Council, the Legislative Council on State-Tribal Relations, and the Council on Military and State Relations.



Representative Milroy encourages the citizens of the 73rd Assembly District to contact him with questions or concerns regarding any state issue via email at Rep.Milroy@legis.wisconsin.gov or by calling (608)-266-0640 or (888)-534-0073 (toll free using Wisconsin-based phones).",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"From Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources:



""The snowy owl rescued by a DNR wildlife biologist Oct. 29 was released back into the wild today. It spent the past few weeks in rehabilitation at Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary.



“It was picture perfect,” said Lori Bankson , curator of animals at Bay Beach. “Today was fantastic. We were laughing because whenever we set up a release and talk about the wind ….well, it doesn’t always work out that way. This snowy went exactly the way we wanted him to go, to catch the wind and glide along the shoreline where the habitat is ideal.”



To assist DNR biologist Josh Martinez in the rescue, brewery managers at Titletown Brewery in Green Bayemployed a contractor to remove a permanent window that covered an old boiler hole high on the old, unused smokestack. The bird was weak and underweight but otherwise in good condition. By the time of its release, its weight had increased from 1,000 grams to 1,800 and it gained strength in a series of flight cages.



The release took place late this morning along the lakeshore near Bay Beach. Martinez and Brent Weycker, president of Titletown Brewing, had the honors of opening the transport cage and freeing the large, snowy white predator.



It is likely the owl, trapped in the smokestack shortly after a long migration from the arctic, will now seek to establish a feeding territory in Wisconsin for the remainder of the winter, Martinez said.

"Detours Ahead as St. Croix River Crossing Progresses



At the end of April, Wisconsin approach work on the St. Croix River Crossing will begin to impact traffic around Houlton.  Wisconsin approach work in 2015 will include grading from County Road E to WIS 64, constructing an interchange structure on County Road E, and constructing roundabouts at WIS 35 and County Road E.  



Beginning the week of April 27th, existing WIS 35/64 will have single-lane traffic in both directions at the north end of the project’s limits.  On May 4th, the southern access to Anderson Scout Camp Road from WIS 35/64 is anticipated to be closed until September 2015.  The detour for Anderson Scout Camp will be to take its northern access at the County V interchange.

""The dispute started when Rep. Mandela Barnes (D-Milwaukee) criticized Gannon for a news release he issued last week regarding crime in Milwaukee.



""That news release called Milwaukee ""the anchor holding back the ship of state as far as jobs is concerned"" because of crime, particularly in African-American neighborhoods.



""Barnes called Gannon's comments harebrained and reprehensible.

"Yesterday, I had the opportunity to participate in a press conference on the devastating impact of the governor's budget and his continued refusal to accept federal Medicaid dollars. 



Wisconsin is a donor state, meaning we already pay more in taxes to Washington than we receive in services. Gov. Walker is turning away $345 million that Wisconsin taxpayers paid into the system. 



The governor’s rejection of this money is nothing more than a blatant attempt to bolster his conservative bona fides for his bid for the presidency. This means that the governor is willing to deny health coverage to 80,000 Wisconsinites in order to benefit one man – Governor Walker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Just how many strikes does Planned Parenthood get?



Dr. Mary Gatter, President of Planned Parenthood Medical Directors Council was caught on tape discussing, “less crunchy” techniques of abortion and going through agreed upon rates of live children’s bodies so she can determine if she will make enough to get a Lamborghini.



If this makes you uncomfortable, it should, Planned Parenthood has been exposed as the worst female horror show imaginable.



More shocking, these illegal actions billed as women’s healthcare have been caught on tape over and over, with more to be released. Planned Parenthood’s private relationship between provider and expectant mother is not fostering women, its criminal.



Here are some of the illegal acts caught on tape at Planned Parenthood. 



1. Planned Parenthood has been caught coaching underage teenagers to lie about their age to receive an abortion.



2. Planned Parenthood has been caught telling women to wait until after five months to have their abortion if they want to abort a female fetus (five months is when the sex is usually determined).



3. Planned Parenthood has been advocating teenage girls as young as 14, to play various sex scenes from the movie, “50 Shades of Gray.”



Dr. Mary Gatter summarized Planned Parenthood’s callous mission as, “you know, the money is not the important thing for me, but it has to be enough that it makes it worthwhile for me.” In other words the only part of human life Planned Parenthood values is the part they can sell. In Wisconsin let’s not make it worthwhile. Planned Parenthood should be completely defunded of taxpayer money and their entire operations shut down, period. 



The list of state’s that have been fighting for the de-funding of Planned Parenthood now include; Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, Kansas, Texas and New Jersey. 



Indiana was the first state that de-funded Planned Parenthood however a federal court ruled that a state cannot withhold funds to a medical provider based solely on that provider’s stance on abortion.  



That sounds reasonable when viewed through the lens of a society based upon law.  So what happens when a state denies funds to a medical provider because they break the law on a regular basis? 



In the 2015-2017 budget that recently passed in Wisconsin, I joined other likeminded legislators who were calling for a reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for family planning prescriptions. The measure would have reimbursed at actual cost in lieu of the inflated rate that Planned Parenthood charges the taxpayers. The measure never made it out of the Joint Finance Committee (JFC) but would have saved the state about $5 million.  With the new atrocious videos that have emerged this week it’s time Wisconsin takes a real stand for women. No more strikes, it’s time to defund Planned Parenthood.

""That’s why I support legislation to increase safety and to provide more information for a woman considering her options. The bill leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.""



Hesselbein added, ""My parents always told me to pay attention to what people do, not what they say. Governor Walker doesn't believe the final decision is up to a woman and her doctor anymore -- it's up to Republicans in the legislature of the state of Wisconsin.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,

"My statement on the DOT Budget Proposal:



DOT Budget Proposal is a Solid Start



Wisconsin has two seasons - winter and road construction.  Yet, we have heard loud and clear from local government leaders from across the state that they need more money to fix and maintain roads and bridges.  For years, Wisconsin has prioritized large highway expansion projects over municipal maintenance and repair projects.  These misplaced priorities have left many of our town, county and other municipal roads in desperate need of attention.  



The budget proposal released today by the DOT goes a long way toward remedying this imbalance.  The DOT proposal includes a 5.5% increase in General Transportation Aid for local governments, a staggering 29% increase in bridge aid and a 25% increase in LRIP projects.  



Importantly, this proposal holds the line on taxes and contains reasonable and sustainable bonding levels (lowest since 2001-03).  I appreciate the hard work of DOT Secretary Gottlieb and the leadership shown by Governor Walker in proposing a transportation budget that is good for Wisconsin taxpayers.   I look forward to working with them next session on this important issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

"Here is a letter to the editor I jut submitted regarding the assaults on campus:



I have been a Whitewater resident for many years now.  I have served my community diligently in many roles and I love Whitewater very much.  But I must say that I am deeply concerned about the number of sexual assaults that have happened recently on this campus.  As a survivor myself, it worries me that day after day I receive e-mails from concerned parents and students about if they are safe on this campus and in this community.  When we hear ‘it takes a village to raise a child’ we must also apply this to other facets of life as well.  Working on and pushing forward the It’s On Us campaign here at UW-Whitewater for the last two years I know that there are dedicated individuals looking to solve this problem, however I’d like to point out that it will take the whole community to come together on this issue.  People come here to further their education and to grow as members of our society, not to worry about going outside alone to be assaulted.  I’d like to take this moment and ask that the University and the City of Whitewater come together to say that sexual assault is not okay and to look into options to solve this reoccurring problem.

The American people are resilient. This act of hate tested us, and we showed the world why America is great. In a time of unthinkable tragedy, we joined together and rose up as a nation. First responders and firefighters traveled from across the country to help search for survivors and clear debris in New York. Americans stood in line for hours to donate blood. Children broke open their piggy banks to contribute to efforts aimed at helping victims and their families. 



We clenched our fists in anger. We shed tears for those lost. We looked to the sky and asked why. But we didn't let this act of hate and terror destroy us. If anything, it made us stronger as a country.



May we forever remember those we lost on 9/11. May we also remember how we, as a country, came together to mourn, to rebuild, and to heal.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"***Consumer Privacy Bill Released***



Sen. Stroebel, Rep. Quinn and I released a bill yesterday that we had been working on with Abate of Wisconsin Inc. for several months now.



In an age of constantly evolving technologies including smart phones, Google Earth cameras and drones, it is a challenge to ensure that personal privacy is protected.



This legislation will codify who can have access to the data that is recorded on a vehicle's EDR (Electronic Data Recorder).  In short, it cannot be released unless the vehicle's owner provides written consent - with certain exceptions to include court orders and auto mechanics in an effort to diagnose a problem.



Insurance companies will no longer be allowed to modify, decline or cancel a policy if they are not allowed access to EDR data.  This does not limit an insurance company from contracting with a vehicle owner through a usage-based policy that would allow the insured to lower their rates based on driving habits.

"The Government Accountability Board (GAB), age 8, died on November 7, 2015, after a long battle with Republican lawmakers and special interest lobbyists. The Government Accountability Board was born February 2, 2007 to a proud group of legislators focused on a fair and ethical elections process. Wisconsinites were deserving of the impartial, nonpartisan oversight of their elections and will mourn the loss of the GAB.



The GAB in was created upon the death of the Wisconsin Elections and Ethics Boards, ineffective partisan boards, desperately in need of reform. The Government Accountability Board is now survived by the Elections and Ethics Commissions, a new similarly ineffective, gridlocked, partisan board, reminiscent of the GAB’s predecessor. 



The Government Accountability Board reached national notoriety and accomplished a great deal in its lifetime. The GAB was at the helm of unprecedented recalls and navigated elections in a smooth and effective manner during the constantly changing laws governing it. It will be dearly missed by many.

"There are days when I know it's too much to bear for a lot of hard-working people who don't deserve to have the burdens. People across Wisconsin lose sleep at night as they worry about paying for childcare, putting their kids through college, making their student loan payments, and planning for their retirement. Workers are tired of hearing they have to go another year without a raise - and by the way they have to do with fewer rights, too. The continued attacks on every worker who makes our state great have made morale plummet. I understand and I share your frustrations.



Sometimes it helps to put it all in perspective. To study the past, and think long into the future about where we could be and how we could get there: through a renewed commitment to our state, our community, and each other.



Pope Francis' words today were a call to action: to embody the spirit of service and live to serve. Every one of us can find a way to serve our community and lift each other up in unique and inspiring ways. So though many of us may feel we are fighting for Wisconsin's soul, we should look to each other and remember that we're all we have. Long after we're gone, the one thing that will remain is the community we built. It's up to us to make the best one possible.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"To all of my aviation related friends... and possibly drone friends out there, I am putting together some of the first legislation regarding drones and aviation safety at a state level.  The FAA is taking far too long to address the issue.



I am afraid that eventually, as with many aviation regulations, this will be addressed by writing it into the FAR's in blood.



If you have any comments or would like to weigh in on the issue, please do.  I want to hear from commercial drone operators, Army aviation safety officers, medical helicopter operators, recreational drone operators, charter aircraft owners, and airport managers.  I did have a good discussion with a couple of Madison air traffic controllers and an FAA drone expert this morning.



Please contact me at rep.kremer@legis.wi.gov and provide ""Drones"" in the subject of the email.  Provide your phone number so that I can follow up if need be also.



Thank you!

"Tribute to a fallen hero

 

This weekend, our community lost a hero. Gary Green’s fight with lung cancer came to an end. Gary wasn’t a smoker. He was a firefighter, “Firefighter Gary,” who served for 25 years as a captain, EMT, Haz-Mat team coordinator, rescue team member, and a fire investigator. There is a sad fact that you probably didn’t know – firefighters die from lung cancer at much higher rates than the rest of the population.  Firefighters literally give their lives to save ours in ways we never realize.

 

Gary’s generous spirit and passion for helping others carried over from his personal life, where he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather, to his professional life. He gave his body and his life in the service of the people of our state.  Gary died as a result of his selfless service in keeping his community safe for a quarter century.

 

I was hoping to meet with Gary shortly before he died, but wasn’t able to get back home from vacation in time.  He wanted to talk with me about how we treat our firefighters, police officers and other public servants.  Gary always gave more than he asked in return.  But it saddened him when people ignored the true sacrifice these heroes make every day and instead focus on how much they are paid or what their employment benefits are.  But how can you put a price tag on a commitment that causes you to rush into burning buildings, that literally makes you walk through fire to save your fellow man?  

 

One of the things I am most proud of in our country is our continuing dedication to active duty military and our veterans. They have put their lives on the line for our country time and time again and they have earned our support and respect a hundred times over. And so have people like Gary. Our firefighters and police officers have dedicated their lives to putting the safety and protection of our community ahead of their own. These heroes deserve that same respect.

 

Thank you for your service, Firefighter Gary. Heroes like you will never be forgotten.  Godspeed.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"We must put a stop to the current corrupt campaign finance system in Wisconsin that amounts to legalized bribery.



Campaign finance reform is the single most important issue of our time because it affects all other issues. When multimillionaires like our opponent can buy elections, the rich get richer and the working and middle class get poorer. 



We must return to a public financing election system that was in place for 33 years before 2011 in the state of Wisconsin so you don’t have to be super wealthy to run for public office to serve the residents in this state. The middle class should be represented in Wisconsin by middle class representatives, not millionaires and billionaires.



We must overturn the disastrous Supreme Court decision known as “Citizen’s United” that allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections. When corporations can buy elections it’s not democracy, it’s oligarchy. We can overturn this by having two thirds of the states call for an Article V Convention to propose a Constitutional Amendment.

"You Can Make a Difference

by Rep. Jesse Kremer



Contrary to popular belief, the United States was organized as a republic, not a democracy. In a republic, the people elect individuals to represent their interests at the local, state or federal levels of government. In order to truly represent the 59th Assembly District, it is imperative for me to have a pulse on your concerns and interests.



If you have ever sat in on any of my presentations, you are keenly aware of my passionate belief that the best ideas do not come from legislators or governors, but from the well-informed electorate.



During my campaign for office last summer, I made it very clear to residents of the district what my personal, religious and ideological views were. Sometimes, however, my personal views may not align perfectly with the majority.



When taking difficult votes, I remind myself that I represent the district as a whole. While I do not always have the best answers to reforming government, running our state more efficiently or curing our social ills; many of you do. So far this year, I have already introduced several pieces of legislation as a direct result of constituent input.



If you have not done so already, I encourage you to become involved in your government and engage in this process by providing your input.



One way you can do this is to attend listening sessions held by your state and congressional elected officials. This coming Saturday, Nov. 21, I will be hosting a day of listening sessions, with stops in Hartford, Kewaskum, Campbellsport, Mt. Calvary and New Holstein.



More details on times and locations can be found at my website, repkremer.com. I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to come share your thoughts, or just listen and learn. I look forward to hearing from you this weekend.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a kid in Bagley, we were either in the Mississippi River or exploring the diverse natural communities and monumental scenery of the riverbluffs. We drank from springs, ate wild foods, built fires, and smelled the earth. Our families and neighbors were farmers, loggers, hunters, trappers, and fisherman. It was impossible to not see the environment as our one and only life support system.



The natural world is the basis for everything: us, our food, water, air; our economy; our future. I've spent my entire adult life working to protect and maintain it: as a farmer, as a volunteer, and with the business I founded. As a politician, I will never stop fighting for a sustainable environment and a sustainable future.

I am a Progressive. For my entire adult life, I have believed that we can do better. For all our amazing accomplishments, our society faces extremely serious challenges. As individuals and collectively, we must do better when things are going poorly.  Similarly, there is no reason why we cannot do better even when things are going well- build on our successes and failures.



We are better together. Rugged individualism and self-responsibility are incredibly honorable attributes. It is, however, cooperation- working together, building upon one another's strengths, and mitigating one another's weaknesses that has fostered our species' greatest achievements. Government is simply a technology; together we can take responsibility and make it work for us.



We are all in this together. We have one planet, one life-supporting ecosystem; without it we have no future.  Greed, inequality, racism, sexism, fear, hate, and suffering foster a vicious cycle of greed, inequality, racism, sexism, fear, hate, and suffering. We are better together. 



The status quo is not sustainable. Consumerism, narcissism, depression and hopelessness, violence, poverty and suffering, ecological collapse- we face big problems. The economic and political systems have been rigged to work for the few that have rigged it. We have largely given up on government.  



I am a Progressive. Together we can do better.



Jesse Bennett

Your progressive candidate for the 49th District's Representative to the Wisconsin State Assembly

13761 County Road CX

Bagley, WI 53801



My biography:

I was born & raised in Bagley, WI and have been a lifelong resident of Wisconsin's 49th District. After high school I studied Philosophy and Sociology at UW-P. I've been married for over twenty years to wife, Jaye Maxfield. We are both proud to have been raised by hard-working families of very modest means. Together, Jaye and I started with nothing and built a successful business, now in its nineteenth year. Our farm and business is 100% solar and firewood powered and we produce much of our own food.



I started my career working as a Merchant Marine traveling the Mississippi, Ohio, Illinois, and Tennessee River systems. Beginning as a deckhand, I worked my way up to become the youngest-ever Chief Engineer for American Commercial Barge Line. Before leaving to start my own business, I had been promoted to middle management overseeing major shipyard repairs, engine overhauls, compliance with new US Coast Guard regulations, and vessel maintenance emergencies.



In 1997 I founded Driftless Land Stewardship LLC- one of the region's first companies specializing in natural areas management, invasive species control, large-scale prescribed fire, and ecological restoration. We average 6-8 full time permanent employees and are a proud contributor to the local economy. As a socially-responsible employer, our employees are paid more than the co-owners and our company donates services of approx. $10k annually to local conservation projects.



In 2006 I founded Hazelton Brush Goats which has grown to become the largest commercial meat goat operation in Wisconsin. Our goats are also used by Driftless Land Stewardship for weed and brush management. We are proud to be the first and largest prescribed grazing provider in the Midwest.



I have been actively involved in the non-profit conservation community for decades. I am former president and current board member of the Southwest Chapter of the Prairie Enthusiasts, a local conservation organization. I have been instrumental in establishing local nature preserves including Borah Creek Prairie State Natural Area near Fennimore, WI. In 2010 I was recognized as “Prairie Enthusiast of the Year” by The Prairie Enthusiasts. I am a frequent lecturer on a number of ecology and wildlife-related subjects.



I am a Progressive. Together we can do better.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

January 9, 2015

Contact: Laurel Patrick, (608) 267-7303

 

Governor Scott Walker Declares Energy Emergency as Precaution Measure for Propane Customers During Cold Weather

 

Madison – Governor Scott Walker has declared a State of Emergency as a precautionary step in response to unexpected and intermittent service interruptions on the Mid-America East Blue Pipeline at the Janesville terminal.  January and February are months that propane customers typically begin refill their tanks, and with the cold weather temperatures forecasted this week and next, this precautionary declaration allows propane truck drivers to travel to other terminals if they need to, to bring supply into the state.

 

“We’ve taken a number of steps in the past year to help avoid another propane shortage like the one that impacted the Midwest last winter, and it’s important that we continue to take proactive measures to avert issues whenever possible,” Governor Walker said.  “Early indications suggest that this is a short-lived supply interruption, but given the forecast, we are exercising caution to protect the health and safety of our citizens which is first and foremost.”

 

The Mid-America East Blue Pipeline is below capacity and has recently experienced intermittent service interruptions.  This pipeline serves four states, including the Janesville, Wisconsin; Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois, terminals and storage facilities.  The Janesville and Dubuque terminals are crucial in supplying propane to southern Wisconsin, but they are also used to help supply propane to other areas of the state.

 

On January 8, 2015, deliveries resumed to most Mid-America East Blue Pipeline propane terminals, but operations at the Janesville terminal, the last stop on the line, still remain intermittent.  

 

As always, carriers remain responsible for ensuring they operate safely during the Energy Emergency and if we can safely end the declaration earlier, because operations have resumed at full-capacity, we will look to do that.

 

The Department of Administration’s State Energy Office will closely monitor the supply for the 250,000 customers who use propane in Wisconsin.

 

Governor Walker serves as Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association, and the propane supply to the Midwest has been the Governor’s primary initiative.  Below are just several of the preventative measures taken in 2014 to help ensure an adequate propane supply in Wisconsin:  

 

• February 2014 – Governor Walker requested that the federal government establish a propane supply chain working group.  On February 1, 2014, Governor Scott Walker sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging his administration to establish and lead a propane supply chain working group to coordinate the movement of propane from where it is available to where it is needed in the United States. 

 

• Summer 2014 – Summer Fill Program.  The Department of Administration’s State Energy Office reports that about 50 percent more propane came into Wisconsin in the months of June, July, and August 2014.  This indicated that consumers responded to summer-fill programs, and many propane marketers around the state reported that more customers purchased propane during the summer than ever in the past. 

 

• August 2014 – WHEAP Early Fill Program.  State energy officials reached out to 25,000 households across Wisconsin that participate in the Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance Program (WHEAP) to help fill their propane tanks before the cold weather set in.   DOA’s WHEAP program began processing applications in August (instead of starting on October 1 when the program officially begins) for the 11 percent of WHEAP households that use propane.  WHEAP estimated the amount of heating benefit a customer would receive and then locked in the lower summer price with a propane dealer who worked directly with the WHEAP customer to establish a future delivery date.   More consumers took advantage of the early application process in the WHEAP program than ever before.

 

• October 2014 – new Hixton propane terminal opened.  Built by CHS, this new terminal has the ability to store 360,000 gallons of propane, offload six railcars every four and a half hours, and load six trucks per hour in the terminal’s two truck loading bays.  The terminal also features modern terminal automation and safety technologies. CHS signed a long-term agreement with Federation Cooperative in Black River Falls to build the terminal at 144 Depot Street South in Hixton.  Federation Cooperative will manage and operate the propane terminal.



In 2014, the Cochin pipeline, owned by Kinder Morgan, Inc., was repurposed to become an export pipeline to ship natural gas condensates to Canada, resulting in a loss of propane supply into the Upper Midwest of about 300 million gallons annually.  The Hixton terminal is a part of a $24 million CHS investment in four states, and is expected to bring approximately 15 million gallons of new supply into Wisconsin annually to help offset the loss of supply that would otherwise have come from the Cochin pipeline.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rep. Dana Wachs Endorses Hillary Clinton for President



EAU CLAIRE-On Tuesday, June 2, 2015, Representative Dana Wachs (D-Eau Claire) announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.



“Like so many people throughout Wisconsin and the rest of the country, I was extremely excited to hear that Hillary Clinton is running for President,” said Wachs.  “She has the intelligence, the experience, and the common sense that is needed to lead our country. Hillary Clinton has dedicated her life to public service, and that sense of duty to her country is what will make her a strong leader and a great President. I am proud to offer my complete endorsement of her candidacy for President of the United States.”



Rep. Wachs was elected to the Assembly in 2012, and represents the 91st Assembly District, which is made up entirely of the City of Eau Claire.



Prior to his election to the Assembly, he served on the Eau Claire City Council.  Rep. Wachs is a lifelong resident of Eau Claire.  A graduate of Memorial High School, he is married with 3 children who also attended Memorial High School.  In addition to serving in the Assembly, he is a practicing attorney with 30 years of experience. He practices at the firm of Richie, Wickstrom and Wachs LLP.



“In my years being involved in politics both as an engaged activist and an elected office, I have rarely seen anyone with the skill set that Hillary Clinton will bring to the White House,” added Wachs.  “In addition to her experience building and fostering international relationships that are absolutely vital in today’s global environment, she has dedicated her career to serving her fellow Americans and giving everyone an opportunity to reach the American Dream. I look forward to a spirited campaign and I will work hard to ensure that Hillary Clinton is the next President of the United States.”",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've heard and read this many times, especially in the last few days. I hope I win this election too. I'll be the first Democrat to hold this seat in more than 30 years. And the first woman ever. 



The fact is, though, on a personal level, I've ALREADY won. 



I've shaken hands with inspiring people, young and old. I've listened to memorable stories. I've made a whole slew of new friends. I've reconnected with old ones (a very sweet thing). And I've been on the receiving end of more gestures, more creative help (best campaign team ever!), more warm words, and more kindness than any one person has a right to.



I regret not being organized enough to keep a journal, but I will have one hell of a photo album.  Here's a little part of it.  I hope it inspires some of you to run for office yourself.

"Rivers2Lake Education Program receives grant, expands program



SUPERIOR, Wis. – Rivers2Lake, the dynamic mentoring program that helps teachers integrate Lake Superior into classrooms, has received a new $75,000 grant from NOAA’s Great Lakes Bay Watershed Education Training Program (B-WET), with funds provided by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The funds allow the program led by the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve to expand along Wisconsin’s South Shore during the 2016-17 school year, in partnership with the Bad River Watershed Association. The Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve is led by the University of Wisconsin-Extension, in partnership with the University of Wisconsin-Superior. 



Seventeen teachers from schools in Superior, Ashland, Bayfield, Floodwood, the Fond du Lac Reservation of Lake Superior Chippewa, Carlton and Duluth joined the program this year. The teachers participated in a Summer Institute from August 2 to 5, where they explored the watershed with scientists, resource management agencies and tribal experts, and practiced place-based and outdoor learning techniques. During the school year, Deanna Erickson, education coordinator at the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, Ryan Feldbrugge, education mentor at the Reserve, and Dr. Toben LaFrancois at the Bad River Watershed Association will collaborate with the teachers in Rivers2Lake classrooms bi-monthly.



Rivers2Lake integrates the Lake Superior watershed into education as a foundation for engaging place-based learning, Great Lakes literacy, stewardship and watershed restoration The NOAA grant allows the program to provide funding for bus transportation, on-water learning experiences in boats or canoes and funding for classroom resources, with an intent of eliminating barriers to outdoor education in schools. The program also helps to network teachers with biologists, research managers, environmental educators and historians in an effort to bring real-world Great Lakes learning to students. Rivers2Lake collaborates with the Great Lakes Aquarium, Fond du Lac Resource Management, Northland College and the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center, among others.



The Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, a research program based at UW-Superior and jointly operated by UW-Extension and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is a federal reserve encompassing over 16,000 acres along the St. Louis River freshwater estuary.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wisconsin's onerous Voter ID law is once again halted for the November Election.



A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Wisconsin residents without photo identification can vote in Wisconsin's November election if they sign an affidavit swearing to their identity.



Federal Judge Lynn S. Adelman said a “safety net is needed for those voters who cannot obtain qualifying ID with reasonable effort.” He went on to say that signing an affidavit is “a sensible approach that will both prevent the disenfranchisement of some voters” and “preserve Wisconsin’s interests in protecting the integrity of its elections.”



Thankfully this law, inspired by Madison Republicans and which has been costly to Wisconsin taxpayers, has been halted while the lawsuit is still pending. Since voter fraud in Wisconsin is essentially nonexistent and is many times more rare than being killed by a bolt of lighting, it always was a ""solution desperately in search of a problem"". On the other hand 9% of registered voters in Wisconsin lacked a government-issued ID when the law was first passed.



It has long been suspected that the sole purpose of this law was to disenfranchise Democratic voters like college students and minorities. In fact it has been fairly clear that this law has disproportionately affected college students and minorities. Our SD10 district has two UW system schools and two technical colleges, and many of these students have and would continue to have their right to vote be adversely affected by this law.



Stay tuned as more information will be forthcoming on how this ruling will be implemented at the ballot box in November.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Wisconsin's wrongful conviction compensation, currently capped at a lifetime total of $25,000, is the worst statutory compensation plan in the nation. It's time to change that.
