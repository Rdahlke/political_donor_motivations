abstract: "The two predominant theories of political donor motivations are the access-oriented model and the consumption model. This paper combines political donation records and social media posts from politicians to test whether either behavior is observed. In the access-oriented model, individual political donors and political action committees (PACs) are assumed to contribute to campaigns in an effort to acquire access and influence politicians into supporting specific policy issues. In this study, the access-oriented model of donors predicts that donations from specific groups of donors will precede public support of certain policies. The consumption model of donors views political contributions as being an extension of voting along a participatory spectrum, and that donors support candidates who they already know support policy issues that the donors care about or are ideologically motivated. In this research, the consumption model predicts that donations from various groups of donors will lag in response to public support of certain policy issues. Historically, these two models have treated political donors as all having the same motivations. More recent studies in campaign finance have found that both motivational models can exist in different groups of donors. However, these studies categorize groups of donors in broad strokes, generally as either small-dollar donors and large-dollar donors as well as PACs. This paper statistically derives coalitions of similar donors and tests the competing models of political donor motivations on these more granular groups of donors who support similar candidates. "

# Introduction

Previous studies on the motivations of political donors have often treated donors as a monolith. These studies would contrast the two predominant theories of political donor motivation--access-oriented or consumption--against each other. In the seminal paper, "Why is There so Little Money in U.S. Politics?," Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder [-@ansolabehere2003] stated that "two extreme views bracket the range of thinking about the amount of money in U.S. political campaigns." They conclude that "campaign contributions should be viewed _primarily_ as a type of consumption good." Similarly, Gordon, Hager, and Landa [-@gordon2007] succinctly asked, "Consumption or Investment?" Welch explained that there two models of campaign contributions. In one model, contributions are given in exchange for political favors (the access-oriented model) or to alter election probabilities in a way that helps one's preferred candidate (the consumption model) [@welch1980]. Many other studies have focused on a single model of donor motivation and seek evidence for that model without considering alternatives. 

Recently, a more nuanced view of the motivations of political donors has emerged that sees donors as unique actors. Different donors may have different motivations, intents, and goals in making a political contribution. Barber [-@barber2016a] examines the differences in motivations between Political Action Committees (PACs) and individual donors, finding that PACs exhibit behavior inline with the access-oriented model and individuals appear to be motivated by political consumption/ ideology. Heerwig [-@heerwig2016] drills down into individual donors by categorizing individual donors as either frequent or infrequent donors, concluding that frequent donors are more access-oriented whereas infrequent donors are more motivated by consumption/ ideology. Rhodes et. al [-@rhodes2018] find four types of unique individual donors: Party-Oriented Donors, Local-Oriented Donors, Idiosyncratic Donors, and Nationalized Donors, with each group having a unique set of motivations. This paper continues in this direction of segmenting donors to understand unique motivations. Instead of making a descriptive distinction between donors such PACs versus individuals [@barber2016a], frequent versus infrequent donors [@heerwig2016], or other heuristics [@rhodes2018], this paper clusters donors who are similar to one another using a network approach where donors in a cluster are similar to one another in who they contributed to. This approach is similar to that of Wahl and Sheppard [-@wahl2018] who then use other pieces of information from the contributions themselves to identify the associations that connect the members of the community to each other. This study takes the approach another step forward by layering in another unique dataset, social media data from politicians, to identify behaviors, and potentially the underlying reasons why donors are in the same statistical community. This paper combines these two datasets to test theories of motivations in clusters of political donors.

This network-based approach conceives of clusters of donors acting as a _coalition_ where coalition can have a distinct motivation. Previous network studies have concluded that this type of network clustering has been highly predictive for other types of political analysis, including voting behavior in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate [@wahl2019]. Instead of focusing on the clusters in the campaign finance networks that legislators belong to, this study examines the donors themselves and their statistically-derived clusters. Further, I believe that this coalition-based approach can capture evidence of donor motivations more accurately. For example, a contributor may only make a single donation. That single donation may not have a statistically-identifiable influence on politicians, but if that single donor is acting in concert with other donors, there is a potential for identifiable results. For example, under an access-oriented/ influence model of donor motivations, this single donor could be a member of a pro-environment interest group. If many members of this group give individually to a candidate, the coalition could exhibit influence over that campaign to become more pro-environment. Similarly, under a consumption/ ideology model of motivation, a candidate could come out with a strong pro-environmental message and many members of the coalition could be attracted to the message and reward the pro-environment stance taken by the campaign. 

In addition, this paper adds a dimension of policy issues. Are there certain policy issues that have donors who exhibit behavior inline with the access-oriented model or consumption model? It is possible that different issues are related to different coalitions of donors with different motivations. For example, perhaps pro-environmental donors are driven by the access-oriented model and anti-abortion groups are driven by the consumption model of politics. This paper combines donation records with social media data collected in Wisconsin during the 2016 election cycle to measure whether campaigns' support of certain policy issues respond to donations from clusters or whether donations from coalitions respond to public support of policy issues. Previous studies have used social media posts as a proxy for public appeals in support of President Trump. This proxy for public appeals was used to study the impact of legislators' posts about President Trump on their fundraising [@fu2020]. Particularly with the rise of politics online, adding in social media data provides a valuable variable in understanding the information ecology that political donors experience and how the information ecology relates to their donation motivations. 

# Access-Oriented Model

Access-oriented political donors are those that attempt to use their contributions to gain access to politicians. Most often, access-oriented motivations are thought to be the reason behind contributions from Political Action Committees (PACs) and donors with business interest. The theory goes that this access can then influence legislative behavior [@francia2003]. Milbrath [-@milbrath1958] centers legislative influence as a communicative process where those seeking to influence legislators must be able to "communicate their power, as well as the facts and arguments supporting their position, when they confer with a legislator." Congress is operating in a "vacuum filled with noise." Political contributions can gain direct access that allows one to cut through all the noise of competing information that the legislator might be encountering [@milbrath1958]. In interviews, business groups themselves said that they seek "access" to either a member of congress or a member of their staff when they make a contribution. But these groups stated that their contribution only gains the access to make an argument and it is the merit of the argument that determines support for their cause or not [@herndon1982]. Surveys confirm that donors to U.S. House and Senate campaigns try to influence politics in a way that helps their businesses [@baker2020a].Empirical studies of financial documents backup this claim that donors seek access in order to influence policy [@fouirnaies2015]. 

Past research has suggested that political contributors are successful in their goals to gain access as measured by the amount of time that organized interest groups spend with members of congress [@langbein1986]. This increased access has been found not only for PACs but also for increased access for individual donors. A randomized experiment found that when it is revealed to congressional offices that prospective meeting attendees contributed to the member's campaign that senior members of the office took meetings between three to four times more often than when information about contributions were withheld [@kalla2015]. 

However, measuring the direct access that political financiers gain from political contributions is difficult to measure. Instead, researchers have treated the "access" component of contributor influence as an implicit assumption and instead look for evidence of "influence" of political contributors on politicians. Many political science papers do not use the explicit term "access-oriented donor" and instead refer to their work as examining the potential "influence" of political donors on politicians. This line of influence research inherently implies a gain of access by political contributors. As Langbein [-@langbein1986] states, "[Access] is a precondition for having influence over public policy. Contributions themselves have little meaning for a congressman, because they do not carry any 'message.' Only access, or some other form of direct or indirect communication, can translate money into influence." 

Even though research has suggested there is a connection between political contributions and access. It is unclear if that access actually converts to _influence_ in the political process. Despite confirmation that PACs attempt to influence the legislative process [@grenzke1989], past research has found PAC contributions to have a limited effect on roll-call voting [@wright1985]. In rare instances, there is an apparent connection between PAC contributions and roll-call votes, but that correlation is most likely due to broader support from larger interest groups [@grenzke1989]. These sparse correlations could be manifestation of the finding that legislators are responsive to changes in the opinions of the national individual donor class [@caneswrone2019]. One article went so far as to conclude that "evidence in the article undermines belief in the military-industrial complex model" [@wayman1985] when studying the effect of defense-related PACs on roll-call voting. One study using meta-analytic methods found over 93 studies that "corporate political activity only weakly impacts public policy and at best has a (direct) weak effect on corporate outcomes [@hadani2017] that may be more of a signalling of policy preference than anything else [@austensmith1995]. This signalling is likely only effective if the contribution is large enough that influence the likelihood of the candidate being elected [@schnakenberg2021].

However, other research has found evidence that contributions from the financial [@hayes2017], telecommunications [@edwards2016], education [@constant2006], environmental [@hogan2020] and healthcare interest groups [@mckay2018] have influenced legislation passed. One study on the connection between campaign contributions and legislative voting does support the idea that moneyed interests play a significant role in the legislative process, particularly organized business interests that are within a member's district [@hall1990], potentially similar to how members of congress prioritize public opinion of their district over national public opinion [@butler2011]. Further, there appears to be a stronger influence as a result of contributions from individuals with business interests, opposed to PACs, which many other studies focus on [@fellowes2004]. While it is "nearly universal" [@bonica2016] that corporate executives of Fortune 500 firms make political contributions, and there is a significant increase in contributions once the business people are promoted to executive status [@fremeth2013], there is heterogeneity in their political leanings [@bonica2016]. 

In addition, PACs have been found to use contributions in an attempt to acquire access and favor, a result that suggests that they "at least anticipate that the donations will influence policy" [@powell2016]. A meta-analysis found that model specification played a significant role in whether significant results were found when looking for a connection between donations and roll-calls votes, concluding that studies that controlled for "friendly giving by including a measure of legislators' ideology and that include more than one contributions variable are less likely to produce significant results" [@roscoe2005]. Despite this variability in model specification, the authors conclude that one-third of roll-call votes are impacted by campaign contributions [@roscoe2005]. Research suggests that campaign contributions only try to influence a small number of votes that have an outsized impact on whether legislation actually passes or not [@gordon2001] or on ideological or highly visible political issues [@witko2006]. 

One consideration when assessing the impact of PAC donations on roll-call voting is that donations are just a piece of the broader lobbying effort when trying to influence legislation. Ideologically extreme groups and groups that are more liberal have been found to favor PAC contribution over other lobbying methods [@mckay2010]. Legislators' perceptions of the power of the interest group, for example, union membership rates [@finger2019] may also be a factor in whether contributions can acquire influence. Firms that make larger political contributions have been found to get more "sweetheart" contracts from the government even when controlling for lobbying, negotiation power, and the employment of former government employees [@ferris2019].

Potentially, the influence exerted by contributors when making a political contribution is so indirect that it doesn't always materialize in statistical patterns of legislative voting, but there is evidence of the influence as a result of the legislation. Interest groups have been found to seek direct _and_ indirect access to the policy making process [@fouirnaies2018]. One study found that firms that donated to winning candidates experienced an abnormal equity return of 3% compared to firms that contributed to losing campaigns [@akey2015]. Another study found that future returns of firms is positively and significantly correlated with contributions in support for candidates, finding the strongest effect among firms that support candidates within the state that the firm is based [@cooper2010]. In addition to immediately-felt financial returns, donors may systematically contribute money to legislative agenda setters, such as chairs of financial committees, in an effort to set future legislative agendas [@fouirnaies2018]. Even campaign contribution from business executives are “best understood as purchases of ‘good will’ whose returns, while positive in expectation, are contingent and rare” [@gordon2007]. Political contributions have also been found to reduce the punishment for business executives who are sanctioned for committing fraud [@fulmer2017].

Instead of focusing on direct access or financial outcomes, this research article examines politicians' public support of policy issues. Under the access-oriented/ influence model of political donor motivations, we would expect to find politicians to be more supportive of certain policy issues after receiving campaign contributions from access-oriented donors, which leads to $H_{1}$. 

**$H_{1}$: Donations from various coalitions of political donors will precede, or Granger cause, increased public support of certain political issues from the politicians to whom they donate.**

Since access-oriented donors are thought to be wealthier contributors, sometimes seeking access for financial gain, this paper will also examine the amount contributed by members of donor coalitions that are accepted by $H_{1}$. $H_{2}$ also serves as a measure of face validity for the theory of access-oriented motivation and this study's measurement.  

**$H_{2}$: Donors from access-oriented coalitions will on average be _larger_ contributors to political campaigns than donors not in access-oriented coalitions.**

# Consumption Model

While the access-oriented model is centered on donors _influencing_ the political process, the consumption model is about donors _participating_ in the political process. As Ansolabehere, de Figueiredo, and Snyder [-@ansolabehere2003] concluded, “In our view, campaign contributing should not be viewed as an investment, but rather as a form of consumption--or, in the language of politics, participation.” They put forward that individual donors are intrinsically motivated by ideology. People don't receive a direct benefit from making a political donation, but they do experience the indirect benefits of participating in a political campaign that matches their ideology and excites them. Said another way, for consumption motivated donors, making a contribution is just an extension of voting on a participatory spectrum. Under the consumption model of political donor motivations, donations are a way for individuals to participate and be responsive to their "perception of the stakes in the election" [@hill2017]. 

Ideological proximity, or the spatial distance between the ideology of candidates and donors, has been found to be an important component in explaining a donor's decision to make a contribution [@ensley2009]. even more so than specific issue positions [@barber2019]. The similarity between a donor's policy preferences and a senator's roll calls is a predictor of whether a donor makes a contribution [@barber2017]. But this relationship between individual donors' opinions and senators' roll-call voting may be a recent phenomenon and has not existed historically [@caneswrone2019]. Divergence of ideology among the candidates for an office, such as a more extreme political opponent, does not seem to impact donors' decision to make a contribution [@ensley2009]. 

Out-of-state donors have been found to have policy motivations for making a donation in an effort to acquire surrogate representation [@baker2020b], but this finding didn't hold for in-district donations. One study found that PACs for organized labor unions reduced contributions to members of the U.S. House of Representatives when they supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) [@engel1998], suggesting that labor PACs responded to perceived changes in ideological proximity opposed to doubling-down on their efforts to potentially influence legislators who have become estranged from the PAC's priorities. Labor unions have been found to participate in "punishing" legislators for their votes [@jansa2018]. However, this punishment has been found to coax incumbents into changing their position back to being pro-labor [@jansa2019], suggesting that there might actually be some influence-buying. However, recent studies have found PACs in the oil and gas industry to be motivated by the consumption model, opposed to access-oriented/ influence model, when making contributions to candidates [@goldberg2020]. Contributions from cotton farmers or cotton PACs were also not found to be significant predictors of votes to amend the 2008 Farm Bill [@callahan2019].

All together, under the consumption model of donor motivations we would expect public support of policy issues to attract political donors who care about that policy, which leads to $H_{3}$.

**$H_{3}$: Public support from politicians on certain political issues will precede, or Granger cause, donations from various coalitions of political donors.**

Individual donors, as opposed to PACs, continue to make up a clear majority of donations to political candidates [@heerwig2016]. And these individual donors have been found to most often exhibit behavior consistent with the consumption model of donations [@barber2016a; @heerwig2016]. Further, individual donors arguably play an even more central role in politics more recently with the growth in small-dollar individual donors. 

With the rise of small-dollar donors on the internet and the assumption that these small-dollar donors are motivated by the consumption model of donor motivations, this paper will examine the amount of money contributed by members of donor coalitions that are accepted by $H_{3}$. $H_{4}$ also serves as a measure of face validity for the theory of the consumption motivation model of political donors and this study's measurement.  

**$H_{4}$: Donors from consumption coalitions will on average be _smaller_ contributors to political campaigns than donors not in consumption coalitions.**

# Rise of Small-Dollar Donors

The growing number of small-dollar donors in the political process suggests that there will be more consumption-oriented donors in the future. The anecdotal examples of the Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump presidential campaigns, both of which received a large number of small-dollar donors [@choma2020], illustrate the consumption-oriented model's connection to small-dollar donors. Small dollar donors likely did not directly access or influence the politics of the Sanders or Trump campaigns. Instead, donors reacted to their messages and decided to move further down the participatory spectrum in those campaigns. Individual contributors are mostly all participants in politics without a an ulterior motive besides wanting to support the campaign they are contributing to. Individual donors are "fickle financiers of elections" whose donation habits can be distrupted by little changes to their worlds such moving to an area that is more or less Democratic or Republican [@kettler2019].

The Democratic Party as a whole has recently grown its proportion of money that is coming from small-dollar donors [@albert2020]. Incumbents have been able to sustain their small-dollar fundraising programs [@heberlig2020]--suggesting that this trend is not going to go away. This growth in small-dollar donors has created a donorate that is more demographically representative of America but is more ideologically extreme [@albert2020] and give indiscriminately to incumbents, challengers, and open seat candidates [@culberson2019]. It is conceivable that campaigns that rely on small donors will adopt rhetoric and tout their "outsider" status in an effort to activate these small, more ideologically extreme donors [@arbour2020]. In the past, extremist legislators have been found to be able to leverage politically divisive and contentious moments into increased fundraising [@oklobdzija2017]. As a result, some have predicted that small-dollar donors will polarize the nation's politics even further [@oklobdzija2017]. Although legislators who receive a large number of small-dollar donors aren't more polarized in their voting in the next legislative session, legislators taking up a more polarized agenda does increase the number of small-dollar donors they attract in the subsequent election [@keena2019], providing further evidence for the consumption model of political donor motivations. Other studies have agreed that mass donors are the cause of partisan polarization [@laraja2012] and some do not [@harden2016]. And so, even though small-dollar donors themselves may not be polarizing, they may provide incentive for politicians to take more polarized positions.

The rise in small-dollar donors has been driven primarily by technological advancements [@albert2020] including growing sophistication with big data analytics [@walker2018], particularly in modeling political behaviors of individuals [@nickerson2014]. Digital firms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google embed themselves into political campaigns and serve as "quasi-digital consultants" to the campaigns that shape the "digital strategy, content, and execution" of campaigns [@kreiss2018].  Along with virtually every other component of political campaigns, fundraising, especially from small-dollar donors, is moving online [@chester2017]. While scholars remain skeptical of the power of data analytics on political campaigns, firms have successfully cultivated their images and businesses around the role of advanced data methods on political campaigns [@simon2019].

# Online Fundraising

The study of the connection between the internet and financial donors has historically been researched in the field of non-profit organizational studies [@hazard2003; @marx2000; @miller2009; @raihani2015] and not political science. The few studies that have researched the connection between social media posts and political fundraising have found a connection between the two [@wang2020]. Before political scientists studied the digital world and donations to campaigns, the internet was seen more broadly as an agora public discussion [anduiza2010; @degennaro2006; @dezuniga2009; @valenzuela2011; @vesnic2012], a hub of political organizing [@cogburn2011; @jost2018; @levenshus2010], and a useful predictor of offline political capital [@zuniga2012; @hardina2005].

Although the study of the internet as a medium is relatively new to political science, research suggests that its communication methods are similar to traditional political communication and can be extrapolated to offline characteristics. The differences that are seen in online political communication, like lowered costs and eased barriers to entry, represent a "difference-of-degree" and not a paradigm shifting "difference-in-kind" [@karpf2010]. There is a strong connection between online channels of communication in the form of social networks and offline connections and building and maintaining social capital from those offline connections [@cranshaw2010; @ellison2006; @liben2005; @scellato2010]. Online social networks have also been used to study offline-based actions and beliefs like opinion polarization [@lee2014], political polarization [@hanna2013], political participation [@lawrence2010] and political discourse [@kushin2009].

The bottom line is that online actions and behaviors have been found to reflect the offline world, and the online world is frequently extrapolated to explain offline actions and behaviors by prior researchers. This study builds upon these previous uses of online indicators of offline actions and beliefs by combining political administrative records of political donations and politicians' social media accounts to discern the relationship between political donations and public support of policy issues. 

Using social media will allow this paper to analyze the textual and linguistic characteristics of the posts. Previous research has been able to study the connection between digital language and political behaviors such as protests [needcite] but not donations. This paper will be able to use the connections found in $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ to explore whether political sophistication [@benoit2019], polarization [@goet2019; @lauderdale2016] or other textual features of the posts that are connected to different models of donor motivation are unique compared to posts on other topics that are not found to have a relationship with coalitions of political donors. 

**$R_{1}$: Do social media posts from politicians that have been found to either Granger cause or be Granger caused by donations from coalitions of donors have unique textual characteristics?**

# Data

Data for this research comes from two primary sources: politicians' social media posts and political donation data. For social media posts, this paper used the Facebook [@rfacebook] and Twitter [@rtweet] APIs to collect social media posts from all candidates for the Wisconsin State Senate and Wisconsin State Assembly during the 2016 election cycle (_n_ = 82,851). A subset of these posts were hand-coded into 27 topical categories. This subset was used to train a BERT deep learning transfer model that was used to predict the topic of the remainder of the posts (training dataset = 8,242, 10% of total posts; testing dataset = 4,122, 5% of total posts). Political donation data for all candidates to the Wisconsin State Legislature during the 2016 election cycle were collected from the Wisconsin Campaign Information System (CFIS) (_n_ = 12,962). These donations were used to create a network of political donations with candidates and donors serving as nodes and donations between them as edges. This network was clustered into distinct communities so that donors in each community are most similar to one another based on which campaigns they contributed to. I theorize that these clusters of donors represent _latent coalitions_ of donors who, whether they operate in an organized fashion or not, are working toward the goal of electing the same candidates.  

# Methodology

These two datasets were analyzed against each other using the Granger causality time-series methodology. This methodology has been used by other researchers to study social media [@freelon2018; @lukito2020]. Similar to political donations, this methodology has been used to study the relationship between social media and non-social media events such as offline protests [@bastos2015] and stock prices [@park2017]. Granger causality detects whether movements in one time series precedes, lags, has a confounding variable, or is not related to another time series. Specifically, this paper compares time series of donations from clusters of political donors and time series of the number of social media posts by each topic that were made by campaigns that each donor cluster contributed to. For example, a time series of donations from a donor coalition was compared to the aggregate count of posts about a given topic made by candidates that the donor cluster contributed to. 

# Preliminary Results

Initial results suggest that it is more common to observe behavior consistent with the consumption model (31% of coalitions, 4/13) than the access-oriented model. However, the access-oriented model is still observed in 15% of coalitions (2/13). Under a strict interpretation of either model, we would expect to find behavior that fits only with that model. These results that find both the models present in the data is in line with some other research in suggesting that there are a "diversity of roles individual contributors play in the campaign finance system" [@heerwig2016]. Specific results of the Granger causality model are in Figure 1 below. 

![Donor Motivation Models](../tables_and_figures/aejmc_abstract_1.jpg)

One theoretical next step for this paper is to flesh out the  implications of observing behavior that fits under both the consumption and access-oriented model of political donors. Most often, the literature assumes that political donors have monolithic a monolithic psychological process that motivate them. However, the clear breakdown of different coalitions exhibiting behavior that falls into different models, and distinct behavior in relation to unique policy issues, suggests that latent coalitions of political donors are strategic actors with unique motivations. One empirical next step is to quantify potential confounders for donor clusters that don't fit under either model, such as geographic proximity or competitiveness of the races contributed to.
