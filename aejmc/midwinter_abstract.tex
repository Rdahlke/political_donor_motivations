The two predominant theories of political donor motivations are the
access-oriented model (Fouirnaies and Hall 2015) and the consumption
model (Ansolabehere, Figueiredo, and Snyder 2003). This paper combines
political donation records and social media posts from politicians to
test whether either behavior is observed. In the access-oriented model,
individual political donors and political action committees (PACs) are
assumed to contribute to campaigns in an effort to acquire access and
influence politicians into supporting specific policy issues (Fouirnaies
and Hall 2015). In this study, the access-oriented model of donors
predicts that donations from specific groups of donors will precede
public support of certain policies. The consumption model of donors
views political contributions as being an extension of voting along a
participatory spectrum, and that donors support candidates who they
already know support policy issues that the donors care about or are
ideologically motivated (Barber 2016; Johnson 2010). In this study, the
consumption model predicts that donations from various groups of donors
would lag in response to public support of certain policy issues.
Previous studies have also posited these two models of political donor
motivations against each other (Heerwig 2016).

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Data for this research comes from two primary sources: politicians'
social media posts and political donation data. For social media posts,
this paper used the Facebook (Barbera, Geisler, and Atteveldt 2017) and
Twitter (Kearney 2019) APIs to collect social media posts from all
candidates for the Wisconsin State Senate and Wisconsin State Assembly
during the 2016 election cycle (\emph{n} = 82,851). A subset of these
posts were hand-coded into 27 topical categories. This subset was used
to train a BERT deep learning transfer model that was used to predict
the topic of the remainder of the posts (training dataset = 8,242, 10\%
of total posts; testing dataset = 4,122, 5\% of total posts). Political
donation data for all candidates to the Wisconsin State Legislature
during the 2016 election cycle were collected from the Wisconsin
Campaign Information System (CFIS) (\emph{n} = 12,962. These donations
were used to create a network of political donations with candidates and
donors serving as nodes and donations between them as edges. This
network was clustered into distinct communities so that donors in each
community are most similar to one another based on which campaigns they
contributed to. I theorize that these clusters of donors represent
\emph{latent coalitions} of donors who, whether they operate in an
organized fashion or not, are working toward the goal of electing the
same candidates. Studying political fundraisers as members of political
coalitions has been studied in the past (Adams 2007; Heerwig 2016), and
this paper's statistically-driven definition of latent coalitions seeks
to add to the coalition literature.

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

These two datasets were analyzed against each other using the Granger
causality time-series methodology. This methodology has been used by
other researchers to study social media (Freelon, McIlwain, and Clark
2018; Lukito 2020). Similar to political donations, this methodology has
been used to study the relationship between social media and non-social
media events such as offline protests (Bastos, Mercea, and Charpentier
2015) and stock prices (Park, Leung, and Ma 2017). This methodology
detects whether movements in one time series precedes, lags, has a
confounding variable, or is not related to another time series.
Specifically, this paper compares time series of donations from clusters
of political donors and times series of the number of social media posts
by each topic that were made by campaigns that each donor cluster
contributed to. For example, a time series of donations from a donor
cluster was compared to the aggregate count of posts about a given topic
made by candidates that the donor cluster contributed to.

\hypertarget{preliminary-results}{%
\section{Preliminary Results}\label{preliminary-results}}

Initial results suggest that it is more common to observe behavior
consistent with the consumption model (31\% of coalitions, 4/13) than
the access-oriented model. However, the access-oriented model is also
observed in 15\% of coalition (2/13). Under a strict interpretation of
either model, we would expect to find behavior that fits only with that
model. These results of observing both the models is in line with some
other research in suggesting that there are a ``diversity of roles
individual contributors play in the campaign finance system'' (Heerwig
2016). Specific results of the Granger causality model are in Figure 1
below.

\caption{Donor Motivation Models}
\end{figure}

One theoretical next step for this paper is to flesh out the theoretical
implications of observing behavior that fits under both the consumption
and access-oriented model of political donor. Most often, the literature
often talks about political donors as having monolithic processes that
motivate them. However, the clear breakdown of different coalitions
exhibiting behavior that falls into different model, and in relation to
unique policy issues, suggests that latent coalitions of political
donors are strategic actors with unique motivations. One empirical next
step is to quantify potential confounding factors for donor clusters
that don't fit under either model, such as geogrphic proximity or
competitiveness of the races they contribute to.
